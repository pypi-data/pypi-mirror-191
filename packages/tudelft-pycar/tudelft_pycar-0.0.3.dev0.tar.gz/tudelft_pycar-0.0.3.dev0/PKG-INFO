# EPO4 Python

This repository contains Python abstractions, serial, and audio handlers for EPO4.

## Documentation

The `pycar` documentation is generated using Sphinx v6.1.3. To open the documentation navigate to **docs/build** and
open **index.html**; **index.html** is the documentation's start page.

## Python Environment

Python environments / virtual environments are used for project isolation and dependency management.
They can be set up as to specify a specific Python version to the project, and install packages locally to the virtual
environment directory. Consequently, the dependencies (or packages) are isolated from the global environment, avoiding 
conflicts between dependency requirements of different project and allowing for the installation of a specific 
dependency's version.

There exist several Python tools performing all or part of these function, most notably `virtualenv`, `pyenv`, and 
`pipenv`; `virtualenv` allows of packages in a virtual environment, `pyenv` allows for several Python versions to be 
installed and run, `pipenv` is a merge between the preceding two tools. More introductory information is found on 
*Flimm's* thread titled [What is the difference between venv, pyvenv, pyenv, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pipenv, 
etc?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe). 
It is highly recommended becoming familiar with some of these tools as they are highly used in academic and private settings.

In the EPO4 project, the `pipenv` tool is used. When an environment is created, two files named `Pipfile` and 
`Pipfile.lock` are also created in the project's directory. A third file named `requirements.txt` can be used to create 
an environment, however, `Pipfile` always precedes the requirements file and will be used in the creation of an 
environment if available in the target directory. `Pipfile` has a `[[source]]` section specifying the repository 
containing the Python packages, a `[packages]` section specifying the packages and their respective version requirements,
, a `[dev-packages]` section specifying packages for development (not installed on the machines of package users), and 
a `[requires]` section specifying Python's version. `Pipfile.lock` contains information regarding the installed packages
and package dependencies. The environment is created in a directory outside the project. For more information on `pipenv` 
read [Pipenv: Python Dev Workflow for Humans](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and 
[Basic Usage of Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/).

### Pipenv Setup (Windows)
First, open a command prompt and make sure `pip` is installed.
```
>pip --version
```
Note that if `pip` is not recognized, it is possible that `pip3` is installed (with Python 3); run the same command but 
use `pip3` instead. In case `pip3` is also not recognized then install it.

Next, install `pipenv` (note that if `pip3` is installed it should be used instead of `pip`).
```
>pip install --user pipenv
```

Navigate to the repository's directory and install environment.
```
>pipenv install
```

After completing these steps, the project's python environment should be installed with the specified Python version
and required packages.

To use the environment (run scripts / install additional packages), it should be first activated using the `pipenv` 
shell command.
```
>pipenv shell
```
A string containing `(epo4-python-'hash')` is appended before the directory. Scripts should be run from inside the 
environment.

### Pipenv Setup (MacOS)
TODO: Write instructions for MacOS.

### Pipenv Setup (Linux)
TODO: Write instructions for Linux.

### PyCharm Setup
To run scripts directly from PyCharm (and for additional functionality). The environment's interpreter can be chosen as
the default interpreter for the project. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project's directory. Use the `pipenv` 
command to get the installation directory of the environment.
```
>pipenv --venv
```
Copy the directory's location, and in PyCharm go to **File - Settings - Project: epo4-python - Python Interpreter**; 
then go to the drop-down menu, **Show All**, go to the plus sign, **Pipenv Environment**, at the **Base Interpreter** 
select the navigation option, go to the directory you copied earlier, enter **Scripts**, select **python.exe**, click 
**OK**, and deselect **Install packages from Pipfile**; save the settings.

### Package Dependencies
The EPO4 project uses Python 3.10; the following packages are specified in the `Pipfile`.

| Package     | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| pyqt5       | 5.15.7  |
| pyqt5-stubs | 5.15.6  |
| matplotlib  |         |
| numpy       |         |
| pyaudio     | 0.2.12  |
| pyserial    | 3.5     |
 | sphinx      |         |

# EPO4 Python Abstractions

## Serial Port Testing
```
$ socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,b115200 pty,raw,echo=0,b115200
$ cat /dev/pts/3
```
Use `SerialHandle` to write to `/dev/pts/2`, the data should be written in `/dev/pts/3`.
In case of a permission error, give permission to all users.
```
$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/pts/2
```


```
$ sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0
```
