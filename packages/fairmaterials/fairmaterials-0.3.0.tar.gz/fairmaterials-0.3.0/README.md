# Fairmaterials
Fairmaterials is a Python 3 package developed by the SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland OH.
Fairmaterials is a tool for fairing data. It reads a template JSON-LD file to get the preset data. The user can edit the data by manually inputting or by importing a csv file or dataframe. The output will be a sequence of JSON-LD files with the fairified data inside. 


# Features
 -  Importing JSON template as JSON-LD.
 -   Modify JSON data.
		- Based on CSV file.
		- Based on dataframe file
 -   Output fairiried data as standard JSON-LD format file.
 
#  Setup
1. Install it at bash
```bash
$ pip install fairmaterials
```
2.	Import it in python
```python
from fairmaterials.fairify_data import *
``` 
#  A quick example
***Select a domain and data need to be fairiried***
```python
fairify_data(dataframe,"polymerAdditiveManufacturing")
``` 
***Output will be series of json-ld format file***
