.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ========
t5html [text-file]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ===========
T5HTML allows fast html-prototyping by using an abbreviated pseudo-html syntax.
.SS T5HTML-Syntax
A T5HTML file consists normally of an import, macro and tree-definition part.
.PP
Each Line is parsed separately, but there are special symbols, which allow the
continuation ("..") or breaking up ("|", "<", ">") of a line.
.PP
The indentation in the tree part defines the nesting-level and parent-child
relationship.
.PP
.SS Comment
Lines beginning with '##' are comments.
.SS Verbatim
Lines beginning with '!!' will be unchanged in the translation.
.SS Imports
@@ filename from path
.IP
imports a file named "filename" from the directory specified by "path".
.PP
At the moment only macro-definitions are imported.
.SS Macros
Macros are defined by an assignment operator ":=". Left hand side is the
macroname, which must be all uppercase. On the right hand of the assignment
operator is the replacement text, to which every occurrence of MACRONAME will
be expanded. 
.IP
MACRONAME := Left hand is expanded to right side.
Macros will not be expanded recursively.

.SH OPTIONS
