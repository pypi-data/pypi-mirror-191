    'description': 'Summer is a compartmental disease modelling framework, written in Python. It provides a high-level API to build and run models.',
    'long_description': '# summer2: compartmental disease modelling in Python\n\n[![Automated Tests](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer2/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer2/actions/workflows/tests.yml)\n\nsummer2 is a Python-based framework for the creation and execution of [compartmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) (or "state-based") epidemiological models of infectious disease transmission.\n\nIt provides a range of structures for easily implementing compartmental models, including structure for some of the most common features added to basic compartmental frameworks, including:\n\n- A variety of inter-compartmental flows (infections, transitions, births, deaths, imports)\n- Force of infection multipliers (frequency, density)\n- Post-processing of compartment sizes into derived outputs\n- Stratification of compartments, including:\n  - Adjustments to flow rates based on strata\n  - Adjustments to infectiousness based on strata\n  - Heterogeneous mixing between strata\n  - Multiple disease strains\n\nSome helpful links to learn more:\n\n- **[Documentation](https://summer2.readthedocs.io/)** with [code examples](https://summer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html)\n- [Available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/summerepi2/) as `summerepi2`.\n\n## Installation and Quickstart\n\nThis project requires at least Python 3.7\n\nSet up and activate an appropriate virtual environment, then install the `summerepi2` package from PyPI\n\n```bash\npip install summerepi2\n```\n\nImportant note for Windows users:\nsummerepi2 relies on the Jax framework for fast retargetable computing.  This is automatically\ninstalled under Linux, OSX, and WSL environments.  If you are using Windows, you can either install\nvia WSL, or run the following command after installing\n\n```bash\npip install jax[cpu]==0.3.24 -f https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html\n```\n\nThen you can now use the library to build and run models. See [here](https://summer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) for some code examples.\n\n## Optional (recommended) extras\n\nSummer has advanced interactive plotting tools built in - but they are greatly improved with the\naddition of the pygraphviz library.\n\nIf you are using conda, the simplest method of installation is as follows:\n\n```bash\nconda install --channel conda-forge pygraphviz\n```\n\nFor other install methods, see\nhttps://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html\n\n## Development\n\n[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for packaging and dependency management.\n\nInitial project setup is documented [here](./docs/dev-setup.md) and should work for Windows or Ubuntu, maybe for MacOS.\n\nSome common things to do as a developer working on this codebase:\n\n```bash\n# Activate summer conda environment prior to doing other stuff (see setup docs)\nconda activate summer\n\n# Install latest requirements\npoetry install\n\n# Publish to PyPI - use your PyPI credentials\npoetry publish --build\n\n# Add a new package\npoetry add\n\n# Run tests\npytest -vv\n\n# Format Python code\nblack .\nisort . --profile black\n```\n\n## Releases\n\nReleases are numbered using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)\n\n- 1.0.0/1:\n  - Initial release\n\n## Release process\n\nTo do a release:\n\n- Commit any code changes and push them to GitHub\n- Choose a new release number accoridng to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)\n- Add a release note above\n- Edit the `version` key in `pyproject.toml` to reflect the release number\n- Publish the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/summerepi/) using Poetry, you will need a PyPI login and access to the project\n- Commit the release changes and push them to GitHub (Use a commit message like "Release 1.1.0")\n- Update `requirements.txt` in Autumn to use the new version of Summer\n\n```bash\npoetry build\npoetry publish\n```\n',
