## Requirements

- [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) `0.1.0b18+`

## Install

This JupyterLite kernel can be installed as a federated server extension.

```bash
# Install the kernel
pip install jupyterlite-p5-kernel

# Build a new JupyterLite site
jupyter lite build
```

See the JupyterLite documentation for more information on how to build sites and include additional extensions: https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/index.html

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlite-p5-kernel
```

## Contributing

### Development install

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the fork directory

# create a new enviroment
mamba create --name jupyterlite-p5-kernel -c conda-forge python=3.9 yarn jupyterlab
mamba activate jupyterlite-p5-kernel

# Install package in development mode
python -m pip install -e .

# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jlpm run install:extension

# Rebuild the extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm run build
```

The extension should be linked to `PREFIX/share/jupyter/labextensions` and can be picked up by `jupyterlite`:

```bash
# Install jupyterlite
python -m pip install jupyterlite

# Build a new JupyterLite site
jupyter lite build

# Serve the site
jupyter lite serve

# Launch a browser to the Jupyterlite server url
python -m webbrowser http://localhost:8000/
```
