# ASCII Movie #

# I now know that this can be simplfied. However, due to lack of demand and its complexity and the fact that I don't want to break it, it will not be updated at this time.
# This was created in order to display the Star Wars ASCII movie using Python.
# However, it can be used with any ASCII movie that meets the following parameters:
# (1) The ASCII movie must be in a text file
# (2) The first line of the text file must contain a number indicating the number of times each frame should be shown
# (3) After that, there must be a "frame" consisting of 13 lines of text, or you can specify the number of lines of text in the function
# (4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 indefinitely; the program will work just fine no matter how many frames there are. There must be at least 3 and the last frame must have 0 as the number of frames for the program to work properly.
# Syntax: from E import movie
# Syntax: movie("text file", "font color", #)
# Syntax: # represents any number you wish; it is the number of lines per frame. Default is 13. Default text color is white. There is not default text file, so you must specify that.
