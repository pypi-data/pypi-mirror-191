Tidy3D is a software product from Flexcompute that enables large scale electromagnetic simulation using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

This repository stores the python interface for Tidy3d.

This code allows you to:
* Programmatically define FDTD simulations.
* Submit and magange simulations running on Flexcompute's servers.
* Download and postprocess the results from the simulations.

You can find a detailed documentation and API reference [here](https://flexcompute-tidy3ddocumentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/).
The source code for our documentation is [here](https://github.com/flexcompute-readthedocs/tidy3d-docs).

## Installation

### Signing up for tidy3d

Note that while this front end package is open source, to run simulations on Flexcompute servers requires an account with credits.
You can sign up [here](https://client.simulation.cloud/register-waiting).  While it's currently a waitlist for new users, we will be rolling out to many more users in the coming weeks!  See [this page](https://flexcompute-tidy3ddocumentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/quickstart.html) in our documentation for more details.

### Installing the package using pip

The easiest way to install tidy3d is through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```
pip install tidy3d
```

### (Alternativelty) installing from source

For development purposes, you can download and install the package from source as:

```
git clone https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d.git
cd tidy3d
pip install -e .
```

### Did it work?

You can verify the installation worked by running:

```
python -c "import tidy3d as td; print(td.__version__)"
```

and it should print out the version number, for example:

```
1.0.0
```
