You can see them by specifying them before help. eg `ember-mug poll --help`\n\n```bash\nember-mug discover  # Finds the mug in pairing mode for the first time\nember-mug poll  # fetches info and keeps listening for notifications\nember-mug get name target-temp  # Prints name and target temp of mug\nember-mug set --name "My mug" --target-temp 56.8  # Sets the name and target temp to specified values\n```\n\nBasic options:\n\n| Command     | Use                                                                            |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `discover`  | Find/List all detected unpaired mugs in pairing mode                           |\n| `find`      | Find *one* already paired mugs                                                 |\n| `info`      | Connect to *one* mug and print its current state                               |\n| `poll`      | Connect to *one* mug and print its current state and keep watching for changes |\n| `get`       | Get the value(s) of one or more attribute(s) by name                           |\n| `set`       | Set one or more values on the mug                                              |\n\n\n![CLI Example](./docs/images/cli-example.png)\n\n## Caveats\n\n- Since this api is not public, a lot of guesswork and reverse engineering is involved, so it\'s not perfect.\n- If the mug has not been set up in the app since it was reset, writing is not allowed. I don\'t know what they set in the app, but it changes something, and it doesn\'t work without it.\n- Once that mug has been set up in the app, you should ideally forget the device or at least turn off bluetooth whilst using it here, or you will probably get disconnected often\n- I haven\'t figured out some attributes like udsk, dsk, location and timezone.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \'Operation failed with ATT error: 0x0e\' or another connection error\nThis seems to be caused by the bluetooth adaptor being in some sort of passive mode. I have not yet figured out how to wake it programmatically so sadly, you need to manually open `bluetoothctl` to do so.\nPlease ensure the mug is in pairing mode (ie the light is flashing blue) and run the `bluetoothctl` command. You don,t need to type anything. run it and wait until the mug connects.\n\n## Todo\n- Test with other devices. Please let me know if you have tried it with others.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [waynerv/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/waynerv/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.\n\n## Notice of Non-Affiliation and Disclaimer\n\nThis project is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Ember.\n\nThe name Ember as well as related names, marks, emblems and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n',
