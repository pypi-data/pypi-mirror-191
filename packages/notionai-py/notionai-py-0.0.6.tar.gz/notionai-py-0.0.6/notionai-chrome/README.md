# NotionAI-Chrome

NotionAI Chrome Extension is an open-source tool that provides a simple way to access the NotionAI API. It allows you to use NotionAI in any input field in Chrome with ease.

## Requirements

To use the extension, your Chrome cookie must send requests to Notion. Therefore, you must first log in to https://notion.so and ensure that you have access to NotionAI.

## Usage


I haven't uploaded it to the Chrome Store yet, so please download the repository and load it in developer mode.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/Vaayne/NotionAI.git>`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and enable Developer mode
3. Load the unpacked folder `notionai-chrome`
4. Refresh any web page and select any text in an input box, then right-click to use NotionAI!
