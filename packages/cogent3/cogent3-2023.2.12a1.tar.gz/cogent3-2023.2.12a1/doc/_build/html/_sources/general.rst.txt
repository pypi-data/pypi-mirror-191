We acknowledge the provision by `Wingware <https://wingware.com>`_ of free licenses for their professional IDE. Their commitment, over more than a decade, to supporting our development of Open Source software for science is greatly appreciated. (The port of PyCogent to Python 3 was made much easier by using Wing's refactor tools!)
