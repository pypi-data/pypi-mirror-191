<h2>Change the placement of support text<a class="headerlink" href="#change-the-placement-of-support-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The support text is positioned relative to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> coordinates of the tree node. Control over support text placement is achieved using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">support_xshift</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">support_yshift</span></code> attributes. These are expressed in terms of pixels.</p>
<p>To place the support text internal to the node, we set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yshift=0</span></code> (so at the same y-value of the node) and xshift it to the right using a positive integer.</p>
