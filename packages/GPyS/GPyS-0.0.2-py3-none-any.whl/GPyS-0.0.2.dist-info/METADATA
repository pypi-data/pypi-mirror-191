## Installation

Install the package via pip using the following command:

- python3 -m pip install GPyS

## Example Use 

After installing the package you can load it via: 

#### For GPS Preprocessor: 
  - from GPyS_preprocessor import Preprocessor
  - Note that only Preprocessor.setup(X) takes in argument X and this must be called first before any other functions
  - The remaining functions merely returns preprocessing quantities of interests

#### For GPS Prediction: 
  - from GPyS_prediction import Prediction
  - All the functions can be independently called here. 
  - Also, user can directly call Prediction.GPS_Prediction() to immediately obtain prediction results
