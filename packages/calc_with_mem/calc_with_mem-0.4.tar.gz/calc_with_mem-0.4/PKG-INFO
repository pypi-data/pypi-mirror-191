# Requirements

The main package file should contain a class Calculator that should be able to perform these actions:

    Addition / Subtraction.
    
    Multiplication / Division.
    
    Take (n) root of a number.
    
    Reset memory (Calculator must have its own memory, meaning it should manipulate its starting number 0 until it is reset.).
    
This means that, for example, calculator should perform actions with a value inside its memory (for this example, the value inside the calculator's memory is 0): calculator.add(2) results in 2.

# Realization

Calculator class object for the operations uses the following methods:

        addition: plus method is used
	
        subtraction: minus method
	
        multiplication: multiply method
	
        division: divide method
	
        take (n) root of a number: root method
	
        reset memory: reset method

Calculator class has an attribute called memory, performing actions above on it with memory's starting value 0.0 until the memory is reset.

Thus, all methods above require just one argument, except reset method for which the argument is optional and without it memory is set to the default value of 0.0.

For example,

        calculator.plus(2) adds 2 to the memory
	
        calculator.minus(5) subtracts 5 from the memory
	
        calculator.multiply(10) multiplies the memory by 10
	
        calculate.divide(3) divides the memory by 3
	
        and calculator.root(4) takes 4th root of the memory
	
Reset method calculator.reset(0) by default sets the memory to 0.0,  but it is allowed to set the memory to the desired value,
providing an optional argument as calculator.reset(desired_value).

Calculator works with integer and float numbers, a validation is performed before the methods are used.
Calculator also prevents from division by zero and a root operation on a negative number.
In such cases an operation is not performed and a relevant assertion error message is provided.

# Package and files

https://pypi.org/project/calc-with-mem/

To start using install the package use:

pip install calc-with-mem

Following the requirements, the package contains already described Calculator() class.

The files submitted:

	README.MD - this file
	
	calc_with_mem - folder with the main calc_with_memory.py module (comments are present in the document) and files to create a package
	
	test.py - unittest checks are performed to test the calculator (comments are also present in the document)
	
	LICENCE.TXT - MIT licence defined
	
	setup.py - used to create a package
	
The calculator was also tested on Google Colab and calc_with_mem.ipynb file added.

The file 115.ipynb was uploaded by Turing College.

PyCharm 2022.3.2 (Community Edition) was used for the project, and the codes submitted are in compliance with PEP 8 requirements.
