The application should instruct web browsers to only access the application using HTTPS. To do this, enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

You can do so by sending the `Strict-Transport-Security` header so that browsers will always enforce a secure connection to your site, regardless of the user typing _https_ in the address.

An HSTS enabled server includes the following header in an HTTPS response:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubdomains
```
Please bear in mind that only HTTPS responses should have the HSTS header, because browsers ignore this header when sent over HTTP.

When the browser sees this, it will remember, for the given number of seconds, that the current domain should only be contacted over HTTPS. In the future, if the user types _http://_ or omits the scheme, HTTPS is the default. In this example, which includes the option `includeSubdomains`, all requests to URLs in the current domain and subdomains will go over HTTPS. When you set `includeSubdomains` make sure you can serve all requests over HTTPS! It is, however, important that you add the option `includeSubdomains` whenever is possible.
