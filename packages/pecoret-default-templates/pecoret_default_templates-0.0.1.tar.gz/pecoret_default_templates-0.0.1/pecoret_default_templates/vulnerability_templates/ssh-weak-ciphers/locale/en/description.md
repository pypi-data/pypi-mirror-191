The SSH server supports weak cipher suites. These cipher suites are currently considered broken and, depending on the specific cipher suite, offer poor security. Thus defeating the purpose of using a secure communication channel in the first place.

Any connection to the server using a weak cipher suite is at risk of being eavesdropped and tampered with by an attacker that can intercept connections. This is more likely to occur to Wi-Fi clients.

Depending on the cipher suites used, a connection may be at an immediate risk of being intercepted.
