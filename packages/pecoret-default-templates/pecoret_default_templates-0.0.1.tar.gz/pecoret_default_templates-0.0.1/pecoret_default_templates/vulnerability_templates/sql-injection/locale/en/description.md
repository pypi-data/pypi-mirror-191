A SQL Injection is not a new or overly complicated type of attack, yet it continues to sit atop the OWASP Top Ten Application Security Risks after more than 20 years of it having been publicly utilized. This is primarily due to its inherent relative ease of use, coupled with its severity of impact when directed toward the staggeringly high number of websites with poorly written, vulnerable code.

SQL is a query language that is designed to access, modify, and delete data stored in relational databases. Numerous web applications and websites use SQL databases as their method of data storage. Applications with a higher prevalence of older functional interfaces such as PHP and ASP are relatively more susceptible to SQL Injection flaws than applications based on more recent technologies.

Applications are vulnerable to attacks when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered for escape characters or sanitized by the application.

An attacker can use SQL Injection to manipulate an SQL query via the input data from the client to the application, thus forcing the SQL server to execute an unintended operation constructed using untrusted input.
