The application should set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header with secure values. You just need to increase the `max-age` value to a higher value.

A secure header will look like this:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000;includeSubdomains
```

The `max-age` value is set to 6 months to increase the chances of the browser remembering that the site is only to be accessed using HTTPS, therefore protecting the user. If the user visits the site again in the 6 months window, which is likely if the user visits the site frequently, it will make the browser remember the setting for another 6 months, thus protecting the user almost constantly.
