Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks are a type of security vulnerability wherein a malicious actor can manipulate a parameter on the web application to create or control requests from a vulnerable server. These attacks are often used by attackers to target internal systems that are inaccessible from the external network due to the use of a firewall.

The most common case is a server application that, to implement a feature, performs HTTPS requests to a third-party server. This request may be needed to: consume an Internet API, download a package or retrieve user information via a social account (e.g., Facebook, Gravatar). An attacker might abuse the feature to perform requests to another third party or profit from the serverâ€™s privileges regarding the original third-party system (e.g., to exfiltrate data).

In essence, SSRF attacks exploit one of the foundations of robust security, trust, by exploiting existing trust relationships to escalate attacks from applications against other back-end systems or even the server itself.
