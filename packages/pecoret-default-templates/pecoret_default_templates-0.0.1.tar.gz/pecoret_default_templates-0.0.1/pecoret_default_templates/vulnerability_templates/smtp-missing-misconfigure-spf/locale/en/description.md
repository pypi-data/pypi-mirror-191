SPF Records are used to control what happens when an email comes to the organization from a knowledgeable and unknown source. The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email validation policy to detect crafted emails, or spoofed emails (using the domain of the victim organization). An SPF record contains a list of authorized sending hosts for the domain. It is published as a Domain Name System (DNS) record as a formatted TXT record.
