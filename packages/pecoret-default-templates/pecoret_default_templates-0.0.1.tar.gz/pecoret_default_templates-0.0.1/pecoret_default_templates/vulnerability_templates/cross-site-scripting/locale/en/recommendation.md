XSS attacks can be mitigated by performing appropriate server-side validation and escaping.
Remediation relies on performing Output Encoding (e.g., using an escape syntax) for the type of HTML context into which untrusted data is reflected.

If you are using a template system to define the look and layout of your application, it is likely that it has support for auto-escaping data, without much hassle. Depending on the system, you either enable it globally when loading the template system or you have to enable it everything time you echo some code or variable in the page.
