A command injection vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server. In the worst case scenario, the attacker will be able to fully administrate the server, which will enable him to extract sensitive data, modify the application contents or delete data.

These attacks happen when user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) is passed into a function that executes shell commands, without being properly sanitized. Because this sanitization is usually hard, it is recommended to avoid executing shell commands within the application, especially those with user supplied input. Instead use the APIs your language provides you.
