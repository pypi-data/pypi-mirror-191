Reconfigure the affected SSL/TLS server to disable support for any DHE_EXPORT suites, for DH primes smaller than 1024 bits, and for DH standard primes up to 1024 bits. Refer to the "[Guide to Deploying Diffie-Hellman for TLS](https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html)" for further guidance on how to configure affected systems accordingly.
