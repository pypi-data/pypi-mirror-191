Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a victimâ€™s web browser is forced to perform an unwanted action, on a trusted site, while the user is authenticated by a malicious site, blog, email, program, or instant message.

For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials (session cookie, Windows domain credentials, IP address etc.) associated with the site. As such, the site is unable to differentiate between a legitimate or forged request sent by the victim.

Attackers executing CSRF attacks have no way of seeing the response to the forged request, since the target of the attacks are transient i.e. state-changing requests. However, when paired with a social engineering attack on an administrative user, this method can devolve into full application compromise.
