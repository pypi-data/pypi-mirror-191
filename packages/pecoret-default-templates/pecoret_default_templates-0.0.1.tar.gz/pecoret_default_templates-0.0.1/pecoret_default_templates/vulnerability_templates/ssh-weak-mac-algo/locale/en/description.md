As with most encryption schemes, SSH MAC algorithms are used to validate data integrity and authenticity. A *MAC algorithm* should not be conflated with a MAC (Message Authentication Code) as these are two distinct components. The MAC algorithm uses a message and private key to generate the fixed length MAC.

MAC algorithms may be considered weak for the following reasons:

- A known weak hashing function is used (MD5)
- The digest length is too small (Less than 128 bits)
- The tag size is too small (Less than 128 bits)
