To fix this vulnerability you need to prevent the full path from being displayed in the application. Depending on how the message is being generated you might need to change its contents or even disable verbose errors to the client altogether.

Disabling verbose errors is the best approach, since it prevents current and future errors from being displayed, without the need to change individual errors and logging.
