Full Path Disclosure vulnerabilities give the attacker information about the application internals, namely the path to a file hosted by the application server. Knowing the full path of files within the server can help the attacker explore other vulnerabilities, such as Path Traversal, Local File Include, and even SQL Injections.

By itself, this vulnerability does not pose an immediate risk to the application, since it is only giving away the location of a given file in the server. However, the name of the file and the enclosing folder name might reveal information that could be considered sensitive, if it gives advantage to a competitor.
