It is common to fetch JavaScript and style sheet libraries from third-party providers as it offers a variety of advantages, not least of which is the ability to leverage someone elseâ€™s hosting infrastructure. But this also extends the overall attack surface, in that if the abovementioned provider is compromised, an attacker might inject malicious code into the hosted libraries, thus transforming a single-entity compromise into a massive supply-chain catastrophe, impacting every web application reliant on the tainted libraries in question.

However, this scenario is not a novel concept. Over the years, awareness has fortunately morphed into best-practice doctrine, which in this case emerges from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is referred to as the Subresource Integrity (SRI) recommendation. This mechanism allows browsers to verify the *integrity* of an external resource, refusing to evaluate the resource if the check fails.
