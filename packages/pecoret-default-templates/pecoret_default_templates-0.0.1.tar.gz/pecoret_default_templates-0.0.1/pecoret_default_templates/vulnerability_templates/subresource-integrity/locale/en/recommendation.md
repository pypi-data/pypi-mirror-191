To enforce SRI, adding two elements to the `<script>` element is sufficient:

- `integrity` a *sha384* digest of the content of the external resource;
- `crossorigin` an attribute that must be set to `anonymous`, indicating that the resource resides on a different origin and that the browser must not send any credentials (cookies) when fetching it.
