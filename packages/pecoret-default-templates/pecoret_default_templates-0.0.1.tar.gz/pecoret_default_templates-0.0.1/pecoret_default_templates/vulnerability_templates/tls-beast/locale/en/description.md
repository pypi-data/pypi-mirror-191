Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS (BEAST) is an attack that exploits a vulnerability in the Transport-Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and older SSL protocols, using the [cipher block chaining (CBC) mode encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC). It allows attackers to capture and decrypt HTTPS client-server sessions and obtain authentication tokens. It combines a man-in-the-middle attack (MitM), record splitting, and chosen boundary attack.
