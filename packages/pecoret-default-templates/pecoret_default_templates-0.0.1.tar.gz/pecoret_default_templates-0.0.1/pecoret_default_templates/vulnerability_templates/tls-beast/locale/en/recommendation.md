Currently, the simplest and most efficient way of preventing a BEAST attack is to turn off and disable support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1., as well as SSL on your server. Doing this also protects you from other security flaws that exploit vulnerabilities in SSL and earlier versions of TLS, such as *POODLE* or *DROWN*.
