The HTTP TRACE method is used for debugging purposes and therefore should not be enabled. This method causes the web server to include a copy of the received request in the response, so one can see exactly what was received by the server.

The request that reaches the server might contain more information than the one sent by the client. Sensitive information, such as HTTP headers with internal IP or authentication tokens, credentials, etc, could have been added by reverse proxies, something that was otherwise invisible to the client. This information can then be used to improve the successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
