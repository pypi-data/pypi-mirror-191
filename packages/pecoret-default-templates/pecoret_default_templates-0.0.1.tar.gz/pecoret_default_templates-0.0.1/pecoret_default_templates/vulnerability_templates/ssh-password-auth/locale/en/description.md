SSH configuration on the server is set to allow username/password authentication. This is susceptible to brute force attacks and could result in compromise assets. 

Moreover, people are naturally inclined to use personal information in their passwords, e.g., nicknames, names of their partners/children/pets, and birthdays. Much of this information can often be extracted via social engineering, making passwords even more susceptible to compromise.
