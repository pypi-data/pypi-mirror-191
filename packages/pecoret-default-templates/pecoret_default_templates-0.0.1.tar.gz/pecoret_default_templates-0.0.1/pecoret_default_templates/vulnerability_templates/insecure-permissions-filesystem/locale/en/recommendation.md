When permitting other applications to read/write files, information stored in files cannot be controlled. So, sharing information by using read/write public files should not be considered from both security and function/designing points of view.

Use of world access permissions should be used only when strictly required. Other means of sharing data between applications are recommended instead of sharing file using insecure permissions.
