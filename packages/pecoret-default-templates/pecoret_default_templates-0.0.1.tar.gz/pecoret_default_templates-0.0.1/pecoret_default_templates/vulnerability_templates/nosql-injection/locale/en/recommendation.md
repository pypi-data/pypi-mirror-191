To avoid NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities, developers need to validate user data by identifying unintended data structure, such as objects and arrays, which can be used to inject NoSQL modifiers that can validate or enforce expected types.

Using typed models will convert the user data to the expected type, thus stopping some injections.

Finally, to mitigate potential damage of NoSQL (or any for that matter) injection attacks, developers and admins must consider the type of access rights afforded to an application. Further, privilege minimization of the operating system account that the database process is running on is good hygiene.
