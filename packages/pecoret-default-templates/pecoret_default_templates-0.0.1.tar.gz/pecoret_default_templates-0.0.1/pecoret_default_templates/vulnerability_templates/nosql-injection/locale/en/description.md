The rise of use in big data and real-time web applications over the last years has led to a marked increase in the use of NoSQL databases. NoSQL was designed in part as a response to this adoption of more agile design methodologies, allowing for dynamic schema definitions, unlike traditional SQL databases.

However, even though the mechanism for data retrieval differs from that of traditional SQL relational databases, security flaws resulting from poorly written code continue to persist since they still serve queries based on user input.

The NoSQL Injection is a security vulnerability that, much like a SQL Injection vulnerability, relies on weaknesses exposed by insufficient input validation, allowing an attacker to view or change backend data that they do not have authorization to access. NoSQL Injection can take place at the application layer, and those NoSQL Databases using server-side scripting for enhancement purposes are particularly susceptible to attack.

A successful NoSQL Injection attack can result in a malicious user gaining complete access to all data in a database server with the ability to execute unauthorized queries and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.
