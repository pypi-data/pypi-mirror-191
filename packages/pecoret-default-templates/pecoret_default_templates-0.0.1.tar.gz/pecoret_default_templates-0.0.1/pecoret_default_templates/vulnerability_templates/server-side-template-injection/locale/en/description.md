Server-Side Template Injection (also referred to as SSTI) is a class of vulnerability related to an inappropriate usage of template engines and can be leveraged to potentially execute code on the system. SSTI attacks occur when instead of being passed in as data, user input is concatenated into a template. When an attacker embeds a malicious payload into a server-side executed template, this can result in the execution of remote code on the server.

Server side template engines are often used by web applications as a way of easily managing dynamic content in web pages and emails. They are particularly common in applications that offer rich functionality such as blogs, marketing applications, and content management systems. Safeguards in the form of sandboxes have been built by many template engines to counter this risk; however, attackers are often able to escape the template engine sandbox and access the underlying operating system.
