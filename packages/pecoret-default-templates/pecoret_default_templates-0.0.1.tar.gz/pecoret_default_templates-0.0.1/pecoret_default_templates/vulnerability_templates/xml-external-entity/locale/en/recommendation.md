Disabling the Document Type Definitions (DTDs) function will effectively prevent most attacks.

When possible, handling data using simpler formats like JSON is recommended. For almost a decade, JSON has been seen as preferable to the use of XML due to its lightweight syntax and newer construction.

Of course, exceptions exist to prove rules, and in cases where it is absolutely not possible to switch off DTDs within the business parameters nor use another format, the following measures must be applied by developers.

When the entire XML document is transmitted from an untrusted client, itâ€™s not usually possible to selectively validate or escape tainted data within the system identifier in the DTD. Therefore, the XML processor should be configured to use a local static DTD and disallow any declared DTD included in the XML document.
