XML External Entity Expansion (also referred to as *XXE*) attacks are used against applications that process XML input by exploiting XML external entity support. By supplying hostile XML input containing a specification of an external entity to a weakly configured XML parser, attackers may be able to view files on the application server filesystem, conduct denial-of-service attacks, and interact with any external or backend systems to which the application has access.

XXE vulnerabilities occur when the widely used XML format (a protocol typically used to transmit data between the browser and the server) contains various potentially dangerous features. Due to the potential severity of XXE attacks and their ongoing prevalence, these attacks make an appearance on the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) list of web application security risks as part of the Security Misconfiguration category.
