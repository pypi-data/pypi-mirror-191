File Inclusion vulnerabilities leverage the dynamic file include mechanisms in applications to smuggle in executable code from untrusted sources. Typically, this occurs when an application accepts user input and passes it into a file inclusion API, loading malicious code in the context of the vulnerable application.

Commonly, itâ€™s called Local File Inclusion (LFI) when the vulnerability allows files to be loaded on the target server and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) when the attacker is able to load remote code in the application, a technique that increases the chances of malicious code being executed on the target.

The impact depends on how the included file is used by the application and may manifest as rudimentary Arbitrary File Read right through to Server-Side Request Forgery and even Remote Code Execution (RCE).

If the files are run in the same code context of the application, this might be used to RCE to gain a foothold in the hosting infrastructure, pivot to connected systems throughout the organization, execute unauthorized commands, and fully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.
