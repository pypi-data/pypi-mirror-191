The certificate sent by the server is not trusted.

This may be due to one of the following reasons:

- The requested hostname does not match the CN or SAN attribute of the TLS Certificate;
- The issuer of this certificate is not trusted. This can happen if the certificate is self-signed, or the certificate issuer is not a recognized Certificate Authority;
- The server did not send the complete certificate chain. This usually means that the server did not send a required intermediate CA certificate.

If this problem is intermittent, it might be because your site is behind a load balancer, and one of the servers is misconfigured or is sending an incorrect certificate.
