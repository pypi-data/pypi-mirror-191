There are numerous basic steps developers can take to prevent Broken Access Control attacks, starting with an appraisal of an application’s access control requirements and then the formation of an appropriate security policy congruent with the findings. This should include an access control matrix, a clear policy of what types of users can access the system, and what these users can and can’t do with their access. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.

For web applications, make sure that the access control mechanism is enforced correctly at the server side on every page and API endpoint. Users should not be able to access any unauthorized functionality or information by simply requesting direct access to the page or object.
