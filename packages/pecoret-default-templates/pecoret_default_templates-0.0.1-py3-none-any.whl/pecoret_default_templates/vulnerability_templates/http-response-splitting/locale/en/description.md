HTTP Response Splitting occurs when a web server fails to sanitize *CR* and *LF* characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

To launch a successful exploit, the application must be vulnerable to the injection of Carriage Return (CR, `\r`) and Line Feed (LF, `\n`) characters, which are used in the HTTP protocol to terminate a line, into the response header. This technique is also referred to as "CRLF Injection in HTTP Headers", and it gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response that the application will send.

The vulnerability allows the attacker to set arbitrary headers, take control of the body, or break the response into two or more separate responses. Impacts depend on the technological stack, with outcomes including Cross-Site Scripting, Cookie Injection, CORS Headers Injection, CSP Bypass, Cache Poisoning attacks, and many others.
