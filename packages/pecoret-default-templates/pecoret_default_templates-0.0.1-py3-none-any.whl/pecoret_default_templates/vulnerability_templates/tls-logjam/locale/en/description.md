The LOGJAM attack is a SSL/TLS vulnerability that allows attackers to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and servers and force them to use 'export-grade' cryptography, which can then be decrypted or altered. This vulnerability alert is issued when a web site is found to support DH(E) export cipher suites, or non-export DHE cipher suites using either DH primes smaller than 1024 bits, or commonly used DH standard primes up to 1024 bits.
