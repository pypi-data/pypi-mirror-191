If possible, developers should avoid building file path strings with user-provided input, especially when the resources are disclosed to the user or executed at run time.

If passing user-supplied input to a filesystem API is necessary, developers must ensure the following:

- Validate the user input by strictly accepting well-known, reputable candidates against an allow list.
- If validating against an allow list isnâ€™t possible, validation should at least ensure that only permitted content is contained in the input.
