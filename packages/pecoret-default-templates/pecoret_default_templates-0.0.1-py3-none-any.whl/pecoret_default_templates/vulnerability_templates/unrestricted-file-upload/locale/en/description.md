Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability occurs due to insufficient or improper file-type validation controls being implemented prior to files being uploaded to the web application. Without these methods of validation in place, a malicious actor may be able to craft the upload request to bypass the application-layer defenses and potentially completely compromise the system.

The OWASP Top 10 refers to Unrestricted File Uploads as a significant risk, and for good reason. Unrestricted File Uploads are an excellent primary entry point for an attacker, offering a foothold into the system for further escalation.

The impact of an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability is usually high given that it facilitates code execution on target systems and web applications. Malicious actors might be able to escalate this to complete access by uploading and executing a web shell that can run commands, attack other servers, and be used as a staging point to pivot to other clients in the network.

Elaborating on the impacts, Unrestricted File Uploads can lead to Command Injection, XSS attacks, Denial of Service attacks, the creation of phishing pages, and other kinds of risks depending on the application technology and the uploaded file type.
