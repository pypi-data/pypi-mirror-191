CSV injection attacks, also referred to as formula injection attacks, can occur when a website or web application allows users to export data to a CSV file without validating its content. Without validation, the exported CSV file could contain maliciously crafted formulas. If a malicious formula is executed by CSV applications, such as Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets, among others, it could compromise your data, your system, or both.

Attackers can possibly exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system, by the use of Microsoft Excel DDE function, or to leak data via maliciously injected hyperlinks.
