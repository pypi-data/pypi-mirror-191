The application does not force users to connect over an encrypted channel, i.e. over HTTPS. If the user types the site address in the browser without starting with _https_, it will connect to it over an insecure channel, even if there is a redirect to HTTPS later. Even if the user types _https_, there may be links to the site in HTTP, forcing the user to navigate insecurely. An attacker that is able to intercept traffic between the victim and the site or spoof the site's address can prevent the user from ever connecting to it over an encrypted channel. This way, the attacker is able to eavesdrop all communications between the victim and the server, including the victim's credentials, session cookie and other sensitive information.
