Unrestricted File Downloads are a type of vulnerability that allow a malicious actor to download internal files, resulting in the potential, unintentional exposure of sensitive files, such as the configuration file, which contains credentials for the database. In milder forms, Unrestricted File Download attacks allow access to a specific directory subtree but could still enable cross-user breaches or access to crucial configuration and sensitive files.

The damage an attacker can cause by employing this type of attack is really only limited by the value of the exposed information. If a developer has structured their web root folder to include sensitive configuration files, for example, the fallout will, of course, be highly damaging. Furthermore, as with many other attacks that are a part of the attackerâ€™s toolkit, the vulnerability can be used by an attacker as a stepping stone, leading to the full compromise of the system.
