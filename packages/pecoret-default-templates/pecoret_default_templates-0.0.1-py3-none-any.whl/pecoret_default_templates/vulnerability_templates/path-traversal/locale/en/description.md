Path Traversal Vulnerability is a type of security flaw that allows an attacker to gain access to files and directories that are intended to be restricted. This can be done by specifying a file path that is outside of the intended directory, or by using special characters that allow the attacker to navigate the file system.

Path Traversal Vulnerability is a common problem in web applications. It is caused by a lack of proper input validation and sanitization. When an attacker is able to exploit a Path Traversal Vulnerability, they can access sensitive information that is normally restricted. This can include configuration files, sensitive data, or even the server itself. Path Traversal Vulnerability can also be used to execute arbitrary code on the server, which can lead to a full compromise of the system.
