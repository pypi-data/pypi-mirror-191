A number of code patterns that prevent CSRF attacks exist, and more than one can be applied at the same time as part of a *defence in depth* security strategy.

- Developers should require anti-forgery tokens for any unsafe methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) and ensure that safe methods (GET, HEAD) do not have any side effects.
- If the origin header is present, developers should verify that its value matches the target origin. Unlike the Referer, the Origin header will be present in HTTP requests that originate from an HTTPS URL.
- The *SameSite* Cookie value should be set.
