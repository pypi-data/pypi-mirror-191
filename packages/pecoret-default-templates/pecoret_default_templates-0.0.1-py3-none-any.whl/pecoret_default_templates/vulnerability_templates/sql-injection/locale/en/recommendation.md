To avoid SQL Injection vulnerabilities, developers need to use parameterized queries, specifying placeholders for parameters so that they are not considered as a part of the SQL command; rather, as solely data by the database.

When working with legacy systems, developers need to escape inputs before adding them to the query. Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) make this easier for the developer; however, they are not a panacea, with the underlying mitigations still entirely relevant: untrusted data needs to be validated, query concatenation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and minimizing unnecessary SQL account privileges is crucial.
