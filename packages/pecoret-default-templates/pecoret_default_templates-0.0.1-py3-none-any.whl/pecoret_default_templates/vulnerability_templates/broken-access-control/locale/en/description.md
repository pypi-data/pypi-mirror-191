Broken Access Control (also known as *Privilege Escalation*) is the hypernym for a range of flaws that arise due to the ineffective implementation of authorization checks used to designate user access privileges.

Different users are permitted or denied access to various content and functions in adequately designed and implemented authorization frameworks depending on the user’s designated role and corresponding privileges. For example, in a web application, authorization is subject to authentication and session management. However, designing authorization across dynamic systems is complex, and may result in inconsistent mechanisms being written as the applications evolve: authentication libraries and protocols change, user roles do as well, more users come, users go, some users are (not) removed when gone… access control design decisions are made not by technology, but by humans, so the potential for error is high and ever-present.

Vulnerabilities of this nature may affect any modern software present in web applications, databases, operating systems, and other technological infrastructure reliant on authorization controls.
