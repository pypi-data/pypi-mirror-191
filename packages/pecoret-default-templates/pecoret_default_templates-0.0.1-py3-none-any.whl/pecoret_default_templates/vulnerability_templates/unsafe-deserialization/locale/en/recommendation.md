It is important to consider any development project from an architectural standpoint to determine when and where serialization is necessary. If it is unnecessary, consider using a simpler format when passing data.

In cases where it is impossible to forego serialization without disrupting the applicationâ€™s operational integrity, developers can implement a range of defence-in-depth measures to mitigate the chances of being exploited.

- Use serialization that only permits primitive data types.
- Use a serialization library that provides cryptographic signature and encryption features to ensure serialized data are obtained untainted.
- Authenticate before deserializing.
- Use low privilege environments to isolate and run code that deserializes.

Finally, if possible, replace object serialization with data-only serialization formats, such as JSON.
