Unsafe Deserialization (also referred to as Insecure Deserialization) is a vulnerability wherein malformed and untrusted data input is insecurely deserialized by an application. It is exploited to hijack the logic flow of the application end might result in the execution of arbitrary code. Although this isn’t exactly a simple attack to employ, it featured in [OWASP’s Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/) most recent iteration as part of the Software and Data Integrity Failures risk, due to the severity of impact upon compromise.

The process of converting an object state or data structure into a storable or transmissible format is called serialization. Deserialization is its opposite - the process of extracting the serialized data to reconstruct the original object version.

Unsafe Deserialization issues arise when an attacker is able to pass ad hoc malicious data into user-supplied data to be deserialized. This could result in arbitrary object injection into the application that might influence the correct target behavior.
