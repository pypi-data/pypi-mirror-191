Cross-Site Scripting (*XSS*) is a vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to manipulate a legitimate userâ€™s interactions with a vulnerable web application. Attackers exploit this to bypass the same-origin policy, often allowing them to perform any actions that the target user would normally perform, including gaining access to their data. In cases where the victim user has privileged application access, the attacker may use XSS to seize control of the application.

XSS attacks typically occur in web applications when data is received and the data is reflected back in the response without validation.
