Sensitive information transmitted in the URL may be logged in different locations such as the browser history, the web server logs and any proxy present between the client and the application. It may also be sent to third party sites through the referer header, just by following a link in the application.

It is also easier to inadvertently share the URL with the sensitive information with an accidental copy-paste or by sharing the URL in a social application.
