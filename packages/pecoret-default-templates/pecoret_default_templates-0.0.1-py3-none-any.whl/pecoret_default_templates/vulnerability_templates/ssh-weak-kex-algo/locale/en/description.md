The SSH key exchange algorithm is fundamental to keep the protocol secure. It is what allows two previously unknown parties to generate a shared key in plain sight, and have that secret remain private to the client and server.
Over time, some implementations of this algorithm have been identified as weak or vulnerable.

Weak Key Exchange Algorithms use components with fundamental security flaws. There are some primary reasons they are be regarded as *weak*:

- The algorithm uses SHA1.
- The algorithm uses RSA 1024-bit modulus keys.
- A weak elliptic curve is in use.
