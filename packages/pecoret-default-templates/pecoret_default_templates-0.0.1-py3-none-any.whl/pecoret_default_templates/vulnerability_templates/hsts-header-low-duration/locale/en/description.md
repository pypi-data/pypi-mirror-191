The application is setting the `Strict-Transport-Security` header but with an insecure value, specifically with a low `max-age` value. A low `max-age` value means browsers will remember that the site is only to be accessed using HTTPS for a short time. Every time the `max-age` expires, the browser will allow HTTP requests to be made to the site, thus putting whatever information is being transmitted at risk of being intercepted by an attacker. The lower the value, the more likely for HTTP requests to be allowed and more chances of putting the information at risk.
