The HTTP Trace method is a setting configurable at the web server level, thus you can disable it in its configuration file, either globally or per virtual host.

How to disable it is specific to the web server that you are using, and independent of the language of your application.

For instance, in an Apache server you disable it in the virtual host configuration file, with:
```
TraceEnable Off
```
