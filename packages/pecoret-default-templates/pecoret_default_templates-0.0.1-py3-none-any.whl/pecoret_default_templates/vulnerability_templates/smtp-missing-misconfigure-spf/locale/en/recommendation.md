Fixing vulnerability requires you to add SPF details on your domain as a TXT record.

Itâ€™s advised to refer to the configuration which is supported by your email provider.

- Compile a list of email servers that are authorized to send an email on behalf of the domain. Update the SPF record with the correct email authorization list and use the hard fail flag: `-all`
- Set an SPF record even for parked domains you own.
- Enable a DMARC policy, and set it to quarantine or reject emails from unauthorized sources.
