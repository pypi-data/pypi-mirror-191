Directory listing is a feature of the web server, thus you can disable it in its configuration file, either globally or per virtual host.

How to disable it is specific to the web server that you are using, and independent of the language of your application. The configuration can have different names depending on the web server you are using. Typical names are Directory Listing, Directory Browsing, Directory Indexing or Indexes.

For instance, in Apache 2.X server you disable it in the virtual host configuration file, with:
```
Options -Indexes
```

In a Nginx server you disable it within the `server` block, in the virtual host configuration file, by adding:
```
autoindex off;
```
