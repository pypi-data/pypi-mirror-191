Add the DKIM signature to a TXT record in your DNS record. This is made up of a selector (the name of your record), the version, the key type, and the public key itself.

Anyone receiving an email that claims to be from you can verify the signature on the email with the key from your DNS. A successful verification proves the message hasnâ€™t been tampered with in transit.

Your DNS record should have the host or record name of:

`selector._domainkey.mydomain.com`

and a value similar to the following:

```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa;
p=MIGfMA0GCSadIb3DQEBgAQUAAfafa4GNADCBiQKBgQCG26OM/bk0vNm/TM2DnOQjPZN252212LGHHjfushjsaudfysuf+DUigzM6h2oJasdasfggMEdNt1S/CWVXW0pUBqafafU0fzdw90+jyqOduh4cCnEk0z0w1w1j4xOYy0FLHhKoeoZJwWQFtwrlhrjxD6jM+sGeeRnbn2rQIDAQAB
```

A DKIM signature should be the last addition to a message before it is released by an email server. Since modifying the email or its headers will change its cryptographic hash, it is necessary for any signatures or standard disclaimers to be applied before it is signed with DKIM.

When using email scanning services on outbound email, ensure they are configured in a way that does not break the DKIM signature (By adding a disclaimer line to the bottom of the email body).
