I watched my favorite TV show as usual, but my parents robbed my remote control, I was really very sad, I wanted to say today was my birthday. You not only don't Send me gift, still do this to me, I asked them what day is today, my mother said that today is the weekend. I was angry to go to classmates's house to play. I silently drop down of tears. I went home until parents call me, they said something happened. So I ran home in a hurry, when I opened the door, a beautiful cake appeared in front of me. A table of delicious food and a great bottle of red wine. My mother set me down and Dad showed me a very beautiful teddy bear with a mobile phone in its hands. Suddenly, my anger subsided entirely on them. \n This is the most important day to me. me. Parents gave me too much surprise and gave my childhood of precious memories.
