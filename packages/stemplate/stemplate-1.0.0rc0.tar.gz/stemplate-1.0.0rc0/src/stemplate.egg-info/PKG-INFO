# Python package GitLab repository template

## Background

Designing a distribution for a Python package is a process that can take a long time.
The information can seem scattered as different entities come into play.
The goal here is to produce a working example of a distribution and to gather information that is deemed important.

## Some useful links

Here is some recommended reading for the creation of a distribution:

* [Tool recommendations](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations)
* [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects)
* [`.gitlab-ci.yml` keyword reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml)
* [Git Basics - Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
* [PyPi classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers)

## Usage

To use this template follow these steps:

* Download or copy the [template repository](https://gitlab.com/stemplate/python-package).
* Replace all occurrences of `stemplate` with your package name.
* Adapt the files as you wish.
* Remove the `.git` directory and initialize a new one:

```bash
git init --initial-branch=main
git add <your-files>
git commit -m "initial commit"
git tag -a v1.0.0rc -m "version 1.0.0rc"
```

* Build and upload the package:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

* Create an API token called "gitlab" for the project on [Pypi](https://pypi.org).
* Create an empty repository on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) (deployment target: Registry).
* Add the PyPi Token variables (Project > Settigns > CI/CD > Variables):
    1. `TWINE_USERNAME`: `__token__` (Add "Protect", "Mask", "Expand" options)
    2. `TWINE_PASSWORD`: token value (Add "Protect", "Mask", "Expand" options)
* Protect `v*` tags (Project > Settigns > Repository > Protected tags).
* Make sure `main` branch is protected (Project > Settigns > Repository > Protected branch).
* Push:

```bash
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:<user/project>.git
git push origin main --tags
```

* Do not work on the main branch.
* After merging a branch to the main branch, if the pipelines passed, add a tag `v1.0.0` "version 1.0.0" directly on gitlab.
