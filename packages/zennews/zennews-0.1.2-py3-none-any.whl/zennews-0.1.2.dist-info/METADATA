# ZenNews: Generate summarized news on a schedule

Project description

# The goal of the project

Points we would like to highlight: 

- The ease of use. It has a nice python SDK which would help you build apps
around.
- The same python SDK is extendable you can implement your own logic. There
are two examples of that in this project.
- There is a complete separation between the code and the infra. With one flag 
we can switch between a local test setup to a remote deployment.
- This is a small example that can easily be scaled up.
