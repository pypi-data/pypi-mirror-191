A sandbox for working with [ord](https://github.com/casey/ord).

For now, api calls go through https://ordapi.xyz/ but an [official api is in the works](https://github.com/casey/ord/pull/1662). Will switch to that once available, or start wrapping the ord crate from python.

## Setup

Clone, `poetry install` then `pre-commit install`.

`poetry run pytest`
