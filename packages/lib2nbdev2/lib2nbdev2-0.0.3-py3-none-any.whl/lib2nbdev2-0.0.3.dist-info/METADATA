lib2nbdev2
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

[nbdev](nbdev.fast.ai) is a fantastic workflow aimed at centralizing
documentation, testing, and source code generation all out of one place:
Jupyter Notebooks. However, what if you already have an existing
project? As it stands the only way to convert your library over is
through manual tasks (which can take \> 30 hrs!).

`lib2nbdev2` is the solution!

Instead, we can perform a one-time conversion on any existing library.
During the conversion process the library will help you generate a
proper `settings.ini` configuration file for your project. However you
can also generate your own `settings.ini` and put it in your project’s
core directory, such as:

- `lib2nbdev`
  - **`settings.ini`**
  - `lib2nbdev`
    - `convert.py`

For generating a valid `settings.ini`, see an example
[here](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev_template/blob/master/settings.ini)
and the related nbdev
[documentation](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html#Edit-settings.ini)

## Install

`pip install lib2nbdev2`

## How to use

From your project directory (in bash), simply run:

``` bash
convert_lib
```

And it will automatically generate the notebooks needed, as well as
privatizing any functions that may need it (anything preceding with a
`_` in the name) where they shouldn’t show in the generated
documentation.

Afterwards you have a fully-functional `nbdev` library, and can make use
of all its goodies!

### Note for Windows Users:

Not tested on windows

## Important Notice:

**This is a one-time conversion, this does not allow for repeated python
-\> notebook conversions.**
