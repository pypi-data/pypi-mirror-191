# Information

**Requires Python 3.7 or higher (3.10 recommended)**

You can get Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure you tick the check box for "Add python to path"
![alt text](https://simp2.jpg.church/PATHe426c23371048def.png)

Mac users will also likely need to open terminal and execute the following command: `xcode-select --install`

# Script Method
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Jules-WinnfieldX/CyberDropDownloader/releases) and download the Cyberdrop_DL.zip file. Extract it to wherever you want the program to be.

Put the links in the URLs.txt file then run `Start Windows.bat` (Windows) or `Start Mac.command` (OS X) or `Start Linux.sh` (Linux).

** Mac users will need to run the command `chmod +x 'Start Mac.command'` to make the file executable.

# CLI Method

Run `pip3 install cyberdrop-dl` in command prompt/terminal

Advanced users may want to use virtual environments (via `pipx`), but it's **NOT** required.

1. Run `cyberdrop-dl` once to generate an empty `URLs.txt` file.
2. Copy and paste your links into `URLs.txt`.
Each link you add has to go on its own line (paste link, press enter, repeat).
3. Run `cyberdrop-dl` again.
It will begin to download everything.
4. Enjoy!

## Arguments
If you know what you're doing, you can use the available options to adjust how the program runs.
