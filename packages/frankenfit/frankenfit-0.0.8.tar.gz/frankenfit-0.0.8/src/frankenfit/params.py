class HP:
    """
    A hyperparameter: that is, a :class:`Transform` parameter whose concrete value is
    deferred until fit-time, at which point its value is "**resolved**" by a dict of
    "**bindings**" provided to the :meth:`~Transform.fit()` call.

    A :class:`FitTransform` cannot be created unless all of its parent
    ``Transform``'s hyperparameters resolved to concrete values. The resolved
    parameter set, together with the fit state, are then used by the
    :meth:`~FitTransform.apply()` method.

    From the perspective of user-defined :meth:`~Transform._fit()` and
    :meth:`~Transform._apply()` methods, all parameters on ``self`` have already
    been resolved to concrete values if they were initially specified as
    hyperparameters, and the fit-time bindings dict itself is available as
    ``self.bindings()``.

    .. NOTE::
        The author of ``frankenfit`` has attempted to strike a balance between
        clarity and brevity in the naming of classes and functions. ``HP`` was
        chosen instead of ``Hyperparameter``, and similarly brief names given to
        its subclasses, because of the anticipated frequency with which
        hyperparameters are written into pipelines in the context of an
        interactive research environment.

    :param name: All hyperparameters have a name. By default (i.e., for instances
        of the ``HP`` base class) this is interepreted as the key mapping to a
        concrete value in the bindings dict.

        Return the concrete value of this hyperparameter according to the

        concrete value will vary among subclasses of ``HP``. By default, the name of the
        hyperparam (its ``self.name``) is treated as a key in the ``bindings`` dict,
        whose value is the concrete value.

        .. TIP::
            It's generally not expected that users will call this method directly
            themselves, instead relying on :meth:`Transform.fit()`,
            :meth:`StatelessTransform.apply()`, :meth:`Pipeline.apply()`,
            :meth:`Backend.fit()`, and :meth:`Backend.apply()` to do so for them as

            parameters that are still HP objects to determine which, if any,
