```{epigraph}
‚ÄúFor instance, when bread is baked some parts are split at the surface, and these
parts which thus open, and have a certain fashion contrary to the purpose of the
baker‚Äôs art, are beautiful in a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a desire for
eating.‚Äù

--Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, as translated by George Long in 1862
