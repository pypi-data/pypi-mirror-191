## What is AQME?  
The code is an ensemble of automated QM workflows that can be run through jupyter notebooks, command lines and yaml files. Some of the most popular workflows include:  
  - [ ] RDKit- and CREST-based conformer generator leading to ready-to-submit QM input files starting from individual files or SMILES databases  
  - [ ] Post-processing of QM output files to fix convergence errors, extra imaginary frequencies, unfinished jobs, duplicates and error terminations, as well as to detect spin contamination, isomerization issues, and more optimization problems  
  - [ ] Analysis of homogeneity of QM calculations (same level of theory, grid size, program and version, solvation models, etc)  
  - [ ] Generation of xTB, DFT and RDKit descriptors in json and csv files that are ready to use in machine-learning models or used to predict NMR spectra  
  - [ ] Other useful workflows

## Installation
Check our [AQME installation in 2 mins](https://youtu.be/VeaBzqIZHbo) video for a quick installation guide. In a nutshell, AQME and its dependencies are installed as follows:  
1. Install using conda-forge: `conda install -c conda-forge aqme`  
2. Install using pip: `pip install aqme`  
3. Update to the latest version: `pip install aqme --upgrade`  
  
Extra requirements if xTB or CREST are used (MacOS and Linux only):  
  * xTB: `conda install -y -c conda-forge xtb`  
  * CREST: `conda install -y -c conda-forge crest`  

Extra requirements if CMIN is used with ANI models:  
  * torch-related modules: `pip install torch torchvision torchani`  
  
Known incompatibilities:  
  * RDKit cannot be installed through `pip install rdkit` in Windows when Anaconda prompts are used     

## Requirements
* Python 3  
* Any of the AQME installation options as detailed in the installation section
* Torch-related modules if CMIN is used (shown in the installation section)

## Example workflows and running tests
- The inputs to run pre-defined AQME end-to-end workflows are available in the "/Example_workflows/End-to-end_Workflows" folder. Choose the workflow and run the inputs.
- Automated protocols for individual modules and tasks are provided in the /Example_workflows/ folder inside subfolders with the corresponding module names.
- To run the tests, run pytest in a terminal as follows `pytest --v` from the main AQME folder or `pytest --v PATH` using the PATH where AQME is installed.

## Features and modules
### CSEARCH
Module on charge of conformational sampling starting from multiple input types (SMILES, csv, sdf, xyz, etc). Options:
#### RDKit-based conformational sampling
Faster sampling, suitable especially for unimolecular systems. Options:  
  - [ ] RDKit standard sampling  
  - [ ] Systematic Unbounded Multiple Minimum search (SUMM)  
  - [ ] FullMonte sampling  
#### CREST-based conformational sampling
Slower sampling, suitable for all types of systems (including noncovalent complexes and constrained systems such as transition states)

### CMIN
Module used to refine conformers generated in CSEARCH through new geometry optimizations. Options:  
  - [ ] xTB (GFN0-xTB, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN-FF)  
  - [ ] ANI (ANI-1x, ANI-1ccx, ANI-2x)  

### QPREP
Generator of input files for QM calculations. Options:  
  - [ ] Gaussian  
  - [ ] ORCA  
  - [ ] pySCF (loading parameters in jupyter notebook)  

### QCORR
cclib-based analyzer of output files from multiple QM programs. This module:  
  - [ ] Separates normally terminated files with no errors, extra imaginary frequencies, duplicates, isomerization to other systems and spin contamination  
  - [ ] Automatically generates new com files to "fix" the different issues of the calculations with strategies that are optimal for each type of issue (Gaussian and ORCA)  
  - [ ] Checks that all the calculations are homogeneous (i.e. using the same level of theory, same grid size, same program and version, solvation model, etc)  

### QDESC
Descriptor generator from multiple input types such as SMILES, log files, xyz, etc. Descriptors generated with:  
  - [ ] RDKit descriptors (i.e. number of polar H, number of aromatic rings, etc)  
  - [ ] xTB (i.e. atomic charges, molecular dipole, solvation energy, etc)  
  - [ ] QM programs (i.e. descriptors from cclib)  

## Quickstart
### Using AQME in Jupyter Notebooks
There are multiple ready-to-use workflows presented as jupyter notebooks in the 'Example workflows' folder. Some examples are:  
  * CSEARCH_CMIN_conformer_generation folder --> CSEARCH/CMIN conformational sampling from SMILES and creation of QM input files  

  * QCORR_processing_QM_outputs --> QCORR analysis of Gaussian output files, generation of JSON files with all the information and creation of new QM input files  

  * QPREP_generating_input_files --> QPREP preparation of input files for Gaussian, ORCA and PySCF from LOG/OUT, SDF and JSON files  

### Using AQME through command lines in terminals
AQME can also be run through command lines. Some examples are:  
  * CSEARCH for conformer generation with one SMILES and name using RDKit or CREST (use rdkit or crest in --program):  
    ```
    python -m aqme --csearch --program rdkit --smi "CCC" --name proprane
    ```  
  * CSEARCH for conformer generation with multiple SMILES and names (i.e. from a database in CSV format):  
    ```
    python -m aqme --csearch --program rdkit --input FILENAME.csv
    ```  
    ** The csv file must contain the list of SMILES in a column called "SMILES" and the corresponding names in a column called "code_name" (see Example_workflows for more information)  

  * CMIN geometry optimization with xTB or ANI (use xtb or ani in --program; use sdf, xyz, com/gjf or pdb in --files):  
    ```
    python -m aqme --cmin --program xtb --files "*.sdf"
    ```  

  * QPREP input file generation from SDF, JSON and LOG/OUT files (replace "*.sdf" for the corresponding format):  
    ```
    python -m aqme --qprep --program gaussian --qm_input "M062x def2tzvp opt freq" --files "*.sdf"
    ```  

  * QCORR analysis of Gaussian output files and json file generation:  
    ```
    python -m aqme --qcorr --program gaussian --freq_conv "opt=(calcfc,maxstep=5)" --files "*.log"
    ```

        If a string is defined, it will remove calculations that converged during optimization but did not convergence in the subsequent frequency calculation. Options: opt keyword as string (i.e. 'opt=(calcfc,maxstep=5)'). If readfc is specified in the string, the chk option must be included as well.  
    **s2_threshold : float, default=10.0**  
        Cut off for spin contamination during analysis in % of the expected value (i.e. multiplicity 3 has an the expected <S\*\*2> of 2.0, if s2_threshold = 10, the <S\*\*2> value is allowed to be 2.0 +- 0.2). Set s2_threshold = 0 to deactivate this option.  
    **dup_threshold : float, default=0.0001**  
        Energy (in hartree) used as the energy difference in E, H and G to detect duplicates  
    **isom_type : str, default=None**  
        Check for isomerization from the initial input file to the resulting output files. It requires the extension of the initial input files (i.e. isom_type='com' or 'gjf') and the folder of the input files must be added in the isom_inputs option  
    **isom_inputs : str, default=os.getcwd()**  
        Folder containing the initial input files to check for isomerization  
    **vdwfrac : float, default=0.50**  
        Fraction of the summed VDW radii that constitutes a bond between two atoms in the isomerization filter  
    **covfrac : float, default=1.10**  
        Fraction of the summed covalent radii that constitutes a bond between two atoms in the isomerization filter  

    *-- Options related to file generation to fix issues found by QCORR --*  
    New input files are generated through the QPREP module and, therefore, all QPREP arguments can be used when calling QCORR and will overwrite default options. For example, if the user specifies qm_input='wb97xd/def2svp', all the new input files generated to fix issues will contain this keywords line. See examples in the 'Example_workflows' folder for more information.  

- [ ] QDESCP arguments:

    *-- Options for xTB descriptor generation (program='xtb') --*  
    **files : list of str, default=''**  
        Filenames of SDF/PDB/XYZ files to calculate xTB descriptors. If \*.sdf (or other strings that are not lists such as \*.pdb) are specified, the program will look for all the SDF files in the working directory through glob.glob(\*.sdf)  
    **charge : int, default=None**  
        Charge of the calculations used in the following input files. If charge isn't defined, it defaults to 0  
    **mult : int, default=None**  
        Multiplicity of the calculations used in the following input files. If mult isn't defined, it defaults to 1
    **qdescp_solvent : str, default=None**  
        Solvent used in the xTB property calculations (ALPB model)  
    **qdescp_temp : float, default=300**  
        Temperature required for the xTB property calculations  
    **qdescp_acc : float, default=0.2**  
        Accuracy required for the xTB property calculations  
    **boltz : bool, default=True**  
        Calculate Boltzmann averaged xTB properties and include RDKit molecular features  
  
    *-- Options for NMR spectra simulation (program='nmr') --*  
    **files : list of str, default=''**  
        Filenames of LOG files to retrieve NMR shifts from Gaussian calculations  
    **boltz : bool, default=True**  
        Calculate Boltzmann averaged NMR shifts  
    **nmr_atoms : list of str, default=[6, 1]**  
        List containing the atom types to consider. For example, if the user wants to retrieve NMR shifts from C and H atoms nmr_atoms=[6, 1]  
    **nmr_slope : list of float, default=[-1.0537, -1.0784]**  
        List containing the slope to apply for the raw NMR shifts calculated with Gaussian. A slope needs to be provided for each atom type in the analysis (i.e., for C and H atoms, the nmr_slope=[-1.0537, -1.0784]). These values can be adjusted using the CHESHIRE repository.  
    **nmr_intercept : list of float, default=[181.7815, 31.8723]**  
        List containing the intercept to apply for the raw NMR shifts calculated with Gaussian. An intercept needs to be provided for each atom type in the analysis (i.e., for C and H atoms, the nmr_slope=[-1.0537, -1.0784]). These values can be adjusted using the CHESHIRE repository.  
    **nmr_experim : str, default=None**  
        Filename of a CSV containing the experimental shifts. Two columnds are needed: A) 'atom_idx' should contain the indexes of the atoms to study as seen in GaussView or other molecular visualizers (i.e., the first atom of the coordinates has index 1); B) 'experimental_ppm' should contain the experimental NMR shifts in ppm observed for the atoms.  

- [ ] VISMOL arguments:  
    **files : list of str, default=''**
