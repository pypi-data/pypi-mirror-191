Use this Datadog CDK Construct Library to deploy serverless applications using AWS CDK .

This CDK library automatically configures ingestion of metrics, traces, and logs from your serverless applications by:

* Installing and configuring the Datadog Lambda library for your [Python](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-python) and [Node.js](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-js) Lambda functions.
* Enabling the collection of traces and custom metrics from your Lambda functions.
* Managing subscriptions from the Datadog Forwarder to your Lambda and non-Lambda log groups.

## AWS CDK v1 vs AWS CDK v2

Two separate versions of Datadog CDK Constructs exist; `datadog-cdk-constructs` and `datadog-cdk-constructs-v2`. These are designed to work with `AWS CDK v1` and `AWS CDK v2` respectively.

* `datadog-cdk-constructs-v2` requires Node 14+, while `datadog-cdk-constructs-v1` supports Node 12+.
* Otherwise, the use of the two packages is identical.

## npm Package Installation:

For use with AWS CDK v2:

```
yarn add --dev datadog-cdk-constructs-v2
# or
npm install datadog-cdk-constructs-v2 --save-dev
```

For use with AWS CDK v1:

```
yarn add --dev datadog-cdk-constructs
# or
npm install datadog-cdk-constructs --save-dev
```

## PyPI Package Installation:

For use with AWS CDK v2:

```
pip install datadog-cdk-constructs-v2
```

For use with AWS CDK v1:

```
pip install datadog-cdk-constructs
```

### Note:

Pay attention to the output from your package manager as the `Datadog CDK Construct Library` has peer dependencies.

## Usage

### AWS CDK

* *If you are new to AWS CDK then check out this [workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites.html).*
* *The following examples assume the use of AWS CDK v2. If you're using CDK v1, import `datadog-cdk-constructs` rather than `datadog-cdk-constructs-v2`.*

Add this to your CDK stack:

```python
import { Datadog } from "datadog-cdk-constructs-v2";

const datadog = new Datadog(this, "Datadog", {
  nodeLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
  pythonLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
  addLayers: <BOOLEAN>,
  extensionLayerVersion: "<EXTENSION_VERSION>",
  forwarderArn: "<FORWARDER_ARN>",
  createForwarderPermissions: <BOOLEAN>,
  flushMetricsToLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
  site: "<SITE>",
  apiKey: "{Datadog_API_Key}",
  apiKeySecretArn: "{Secret_ARN_Datadog_API_Key}",
  apiKmsKey: "{Encrypted_Datadog_API_Key}",
  enableDatadogTracing: <BOOLEAN>,
  enableMergeXrayTraces: <BOOLEAN>,
  enableDatadogLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
  injectLogContext: <BOOLEAN>,
  logLevel: <STRING>,
  env: <STRING>, //Optional
  service: <STRING>, //Optional
  version: <STRING>, //Optional
  tags: <STRING>, //Optional
});
datadog.addLambdaFunctions([<LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS>])
datadog.addForwarderToNonLambdaLogGroups([<LOG_GROUPS>])
```

Optionally, if you'd like to enable [source code integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/guide/source-code-integration/) (Typescript only), you'll need to make a few changes to your stack setup since the AWS CDK does not support async functions.

Change your initialization function as follows (note: we're changing this to pass the `gitHash` and `gitRepoUrl` values to the CDK):

```python
async function main() {
  // Make sure to add @datadog/datadog-ci via your package manager
  const datadogCi = require("@datadog/datadog-ci");
  const [gitRepoUrl, gitHash] = await datadogCi.gitMetadata.getGitCommitInfo();

  const app = new cdk.App();
  // Pass in the hash and repo url to the ExampleStack constructor
  new ExampleStack(app, "ExampleStack", {}, gitHash, gitRepoUrl);
}
```

Ensure you call this function to initialize your stack.

In your stack constructor, change to add an optional `gitHash` parameter, and call `addGitCommitMetadata()`:

```python
export class ExampleStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps, gitHash?: string, gitRepoUrl?:string) {
    ...
    ...
    datadog.addGitCommitMetadata([<YOUR_FUNCTIONS>], gitHash, gitRepoUrl);
  }
}
```

### Legacy Source Code Integration

If you are using older versions of the following dependencies:

* @datadog/datadog-ci < v2.4.0
* datadog-cdk-constructs-v2 < v2-1.3.0
* datadog-cdk-constructs < 0.8.4

We highly encourage you to upgrade to the latest version. Otherwise, refer to the legacy documentation for enabling source code integration below.

<details>
  <summary>Legacy Source Code Integration</summary>

Change your initialization function as follows (note: we're changing this to pass just the `gitHash` value to the CDK):

```python
async function main() {
  // Make sure to add @datadog/datadog-ci via your package manager
  const datadogCi = require("@datadog/datadog-ci");
  const [, gitHash] = await datadogCi.gitMetadata.uploadGitCommitHash('{Datadog_API_Key}', '<SITE>')

  const app = new cdk.App();
  // Pass in the hash to the ExampleStack constructor
  new ExampleStack(app, "ExampleStack", {}, gitHash);
}
```

In your stack constructor, change to add an optional `gitHash` parameter, and call `addGitCommitMetadata()`:

```python
export class ExampleStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps, gitHash?: string) {
    ...
    ...
    datadog.addGitCommitMetadata([<YOUR_FUNCTIONS>], gitHash)
  }
}
```

</details>

## Configuration

To further configure your Datadog construct, use the following custom parameters:

*Note*: The descriptions use the npm package parameters, but they also apply to the PyPI package parameters.

| npm package parameter | PyPI package parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addLayers` | `add_layers` | Whether to add the Lambda Layers or expect the user to bring their own. Defaults to true. When true, the Lambda Library version variables are also required. When false, you must include the Datadog Lambda library in your functions' deployment packages. |
| `pythonLayerVersion` | `python_layer_version` | Version of the Python Lambda layer to install, such as 21. Required if you are deploying at least one Lambda function written in Python and `addLayers` is true. Find the latest version number [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-python/releases). |
| `nodeLayerVersion` | `node_layer_version` | Version of the Node.js Lambda layer to install, such as 29. Required if you are deploying at least one Lambda function written in Node.js and `addLayers` is true. Find the latest version number from [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-js/releases). |
| `extensionLayerVersion` | `extension_layer_version` | Version of the Datadog Lambda Extension layer to install, such as 5. When `extensionLayerVersion` is set, `apiKey` (or if encrypted, `apiKMSKey` or `apiKeySecretArn`) needs to be set as well. When enabled, lambda function log groups will not be subscribed by the forwarder. Learn more about the Lambda extension [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/datadog_lambda_library/extension/). |
| `forwarderArn` | `forwarder_arn` | When set, the plugin will automatically subscribe the Datadog Forwarder to the functions' log groups. Do not set `forwarderArn` when `extensionLayerVersion` is set. |
| `createForwarderPermissions` | `createForwarderPermissions` | When set to `true`, creates a Lambda permission on the the Datadog Forwarder per log group. Since the Datadog Forwarder has permissions configured by default, this is unnecessary in most use cases. |
| `flushMetricsToLogs` | `flush_metrics_to_logs` | Send custom metrics using CloudWatch logs with the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function (recommended). Defaults to `true` . If you disable this parameter, it's required to set `apiKey` (or if encrypted, `apiKMSKey` or `apiKeySecretArn`). |
| `site` | `site` | Set which Datadog site to send data. This is only used when `flushMetricsToLogs` is `false` or `extensionLayerVersion` is set. Possible values are `datadoghq.com`, `datadoghq.eu`, `us3.datadoghq.com`, `us5.datadoghq.com`, and `ddog-gov.com`. The default is `datadoghq.com`. |
| `apiKey` | `api_key` | Datadog API Key, only needed when `flushMetricsToLogs` is `false` or `extensionLayerVersion` is set. For more information about getting a Datadog API key, see the [API key documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#api-keys). |
| `apiKeySecretArn` | `api_key_secret_arn` | The ARN of the secret storing the Datadog API key in AWS Secrets Manager. Use this parameter in place of `apiKey` when `flushMetricsToLogs` is `false` or `extensionLayer` is set. Remember to add the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the Lambda execution role. |
| `apiKmsKey` | `api_kms_key` | Datadog API Key encrypted using KMS. Use this parameter in place of `apiKey` when `flushMetricsToLogs` is `false` or `extensionLayerVersion` is set, and you are using KMS encryption. |
| `enableDatadogTracing` | `enable_datadog_tracing` | Enable Datadog tracing on your Lambda functions. Defaults to `true`. |
| `enableMergeXrayTraces` | `enable_merge_xray_traces` | Enable merging X-Ray traces on your Lambda functions. Defaults to `false`. |
| `enableDatadogLogs` | `enable_datadog_logs` | Send Lambda function logs to Datadog via the Datadog Lambda Extension.  Defaults to `true`. Note: This setting has no effect on logs sent via the Datadog Forwarder. |
| `injectLogContext` | `inject_log_context` | When set, the Lambda layer will automatically patch console.log with Datadog's tracing ids. Defaults to `true`. |
| `logLevel` | `log_level` | When set to `debug`, the Datadog Lambda Library and Extension will log additional information to help troubleshoot issues. |
| `env` | `env` | When set along with `extensionLayerVersion`, a `DD_ENV` environment variable is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. When set along with `forwarderArn`, an `env` tag is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. |
| `service` | `service` | When set along with `extensionLayerVersion`, a `DD_SERVICE` environment variable is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. When set along with `forwarderArn`, a `service` tag is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. |
| `version` | `version` | When set along with `extensionLayerVersion`, a `DD_VERSION` environment variable is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. When set along with `forwarderArn`, a `version` tag is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. |
| `tags` | `tags` | A comma separated list of key:value pairs as a single string. When set along with `extensionLayerVersion`, a `DD_TAGS` environment variable is added to all Lambda functions with the provided value. When set along with `forwarderArn`, the cdk parses the string and sets each key:value pair as a tag to all Lambda functions. |

**Note**: `env`, `service`, `version`, and `tags` override function level `DD_XXX` environment variables.

### Tracing

Enable X-Ray Tracing on your Lambda functions. For more information, see [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.Tracing.html).

```python
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";

const lambda_function = new lambda.Function(this, "HelloHandler", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("lambda"),
  handler: "hello.handler",
  tracing: lambda.Tracing.ACTIVE,
});
```

### Nested Stacks

Add the Datadog CDK Construct to each stack you wish to instrument with Datadog. In the example below, we initialize the Datadog CDK Construct and call `addLambdaFunctions()` in both the `RootStack` and `NestedStack`.

```python
import { Datadog } from "datadog-cdk-constructs-v2";
import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";

class RootStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    new NestedStack(this, "NestedStack");

    const datadog = new Datadog(this, "Datadog", {
      nodeLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
      pythonLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
      addLayers: <BOOLEAN>,
      forwarderArn: "<FORWARDER_ARN>",
      flushMetricsToLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
      site: "<SITE>",
      apiKey: "{Datadog_API_Key}",
      apiKeySecretArn: "{Secret_ARN_Datadog_API_Key}",
      apiKmsKey: "{Encrypted_Datadog_API_Key}",
      enableDatadogTracing: <BOOLEAN>,
      enableMergeXrayTraces: <BOOLEAN>,
      enableDatadogLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
      injectLogContext: <BOOLEAN>
    });
    datadog.addLambdaFunctions([<LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS>]);

  }
}

class NestedStack extends cdk.NestedStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.NestedStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const datadog = new Datadog(this, "Datadog", {
      nodeLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
      pythonLayerVersion: <LAYER_VERSION>,
      addLayers: <BOOLEAN>,
      forwarderArn: "<FORWARDER_ARN>",
      flushMetricsToLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
      site: "<SITE>",
      apiKey: "{Datadog_API_Key}",
      apiKeySecretArn: "{Secret_ARN_Datadog_API_Key}",
      apiKmsKey: "{Encrypted_Datadog_API_Key}",
      enableDatadogTracing: <BOOLEAN>,
      enableMergeXrayTraces: <BOOLEAN>,
      enableDatadogLogs: <BOOLEAN>,
      injectLogContext: <BOOLEAN>
    });
    datadog.addLambdaFunctions([<LAMBDA_FUNCTIONS>]);

  }
}
```

### Tags

Add tags to your constructs. We recommend setting an `env` and `service` tag to tie Datadog telemetry together. For more information see [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tagging.html) and [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Tags.html).

## How it works

The Datadog CDK construct takes in a list of lambda functions and installs the Datadog Lambda Library by attaching the Lambda Layers for [Node.js](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-js) and [Python](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-lambda-layer-python) to your functions. It redirects to a replacement handler that initializes the Lambda Library without any required code changes. Additional configurations added to the Datadog CDK construct will also translate into their respective environment variables under each lambda function (if applicable / required).

While Lambda function based log groups are handled by the `addLambdaFunctions` method automatically, the construct has an additional function `addForwarderToNonLambdaLogGroups` which subscribes the forwarder to any additional log groups of your choosing.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, the folders `v1` and `v2` correspond to the packages `datadog-cdk-constructs` and `datadog-cdk-contructs-v2`. Each can be treated as a separate project (they are separate projen projects with separate dependencies, config files, tests, and scripts).

Additionally, there is a `common` folder that contains shared logic common to both `v1` and `v2` packages. This is done by soft-linking a `common` folder within `v1/src` and `v2/src` to the `common` folder in the root of the repository.

## Using Projen

The `v1` and `v2` Datadog CDK Construct Libraries both use Projen to maintain project configuration files such as the `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`, etc. Most of the configuration files will be protected by Projen via read-only permissions. In order to change these files, edit the `.projenrc.js` file within `v1` or `v2` folders, then run `npx projen` (while in `v1` or `v2`) to synthesize the new changes. Check out [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) for more details.

## Opening Issues

If you encounter a bug with this package, we want to hear about it. Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

When opening an issue, include the Datadog CDK Construct version, Node version, and stack trace if available. In addition, include the steps to reproduce when appropriate.

You can also open an issue for a feature request.

## Contributing

If you find an issue with this package and have a fix, please feel free to open a pull request following the [procedures](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-cdk-constructs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing

If you contribute to this package you can run the tests using `yarn test` within the `v1` or `v2` folders. This package also includes a sample application for manual testing:

1. Open a seperate terminal and `cd` into `v1` or `v2`.
2. Run `yarn watch`, this will ensure the Typescript files in the `src` directory are compiled to Javascript in the `lib` directory.
3. Navigate to `src/sample`, here you can edit `index.ts` to test your contributions manually.
4. At the root of the `v1` or `v2` directory (whichever you are working on), run `npx cdk --app lib/sample/index.js <CDK Command>`, replacing `<CDK Command>` with common CDK commands like `synth`, `diff`, or `deploy`.

* Note, if you receive "... is not authorized to perform: ..." you may also need to authorize the commands with your AWS credentials.

### Debug Logs

To display the debug logs for this library, set the `DD_CONSTRUCT_DEBUG_LOGS` env var to `true` when running `cdk synth` (use `--quiet` to suppress generated template output).

Example:
*Ensure you are at the root of the `v1` or `v2` directory*

```
DD_CONSTRUCT_DEBUG_LOGS=true npx cdk --app lib/sample/index.js synth --quiet
```
