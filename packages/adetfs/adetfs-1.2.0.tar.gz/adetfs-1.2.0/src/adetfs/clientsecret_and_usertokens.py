"""Module that returns arguments that are needed for fitbit_main program

Requires:
properties.ini: File that has the path for the token.txt and cr.txt files
                properties.ini layout example can be found from Readme.md file
token.txt:  File that has user_id,access_token and refresh_token for each user whose data is being exported.
            One line per user and arguments separated by comma
cr.txt:     File that contains client_id and client_secret on one line separated by comma

Program has two classes:

ClientIdPwd class returns client_id and client_secret
UserToken class returns user_id,access_token and refresh_token

Client_id and secret need to be saved in txt file and they can be obtained by creating Fitbit Application

Access and Refresh token can be obtained using module 'fetch_tokens_to_file'

Returns:
String
