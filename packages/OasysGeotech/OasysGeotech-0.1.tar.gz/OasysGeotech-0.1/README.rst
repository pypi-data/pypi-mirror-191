A work in progress module for the OASYS Geotechnics suite.

The module features all the COM interface commands for SLOPE, ALP and PDISP.

The module is aimed at aiding in writing scripts - as the COM commands required the user to refer to the manual. Through an IDE you can now see a list of available commands, and what variables it takes.
