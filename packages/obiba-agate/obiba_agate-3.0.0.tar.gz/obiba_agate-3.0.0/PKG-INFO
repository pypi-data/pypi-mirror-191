# Agate Python [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/obiba/agate-python-client.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/obiba/agate-python-client)

This Python-based command line tool allows to access to a Agate server through its REST API. This is the perfect tool
for automating tasks in Agate. This will be the preferred client developed when new features are added to the REST API.

* Read the [documentation](http://agatedoc.obiba.org).
* Have a bug or a question? Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/obiba/agate-python-client/issues).
* Continuous integration is on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/obiba/agate-python-client).

## Usage

Install with:

```
pip install obiba-agate
```

To get the options of the command line:

```
agate --help
```

This command will display which sub-commands are available. For each sub-command you can get the help message as well:

```
agate <subcommand> --help
```

The objective of having sub-command is to hide the complexity of applying some use cases to the Agate REST API. More
sub-commands will be developed in the future.

## Development

Agate Python client can be easily extended by using the classes defined in `core.py` and in `protobuf/*.py` files.
