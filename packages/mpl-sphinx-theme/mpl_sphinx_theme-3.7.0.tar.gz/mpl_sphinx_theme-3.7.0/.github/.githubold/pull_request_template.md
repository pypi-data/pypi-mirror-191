## PR Summary


<!--
To create a new package yml, make a new file with your package name in the `packages/`
directory with a  yml suffix.  Examples can be seen in the `packages/` directory, but 
at the minimum you need to include the `repo:`, `section:` and `description:` fields.  
Please keep the description very short.  

Other useful fields are `site:`, `pypi_name`, `conda_package`, (if different from the 
github name), and `conda_channel` if not *conda-forge*.
