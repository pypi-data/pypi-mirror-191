<h1>Hello, Welcome to ZinckLib</h1>

The main focus of this library is around the manipulation of strings between various forms like strings to numbers or 
converting a number to its written form. There are also some other tools like creating a list of prime numbers less than
a given value or determining if a string is in alphabetical order.
