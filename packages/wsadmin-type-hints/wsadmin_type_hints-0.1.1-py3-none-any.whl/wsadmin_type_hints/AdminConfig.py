"""
Use the `AdminConfig` object to invoke configuration commands and to create or 
change elements of the WebSphereÂ® Application Server configuration, for example, 
creating a data source.

You can start the scripting client without a running server, if you only want to 
use local operations. 
To run in local mode, use the `-conntype NONE` option to start the scripting client. 
You receive a message that you are running in the local mode. 
If a server is currently running, do not run the `AdminConfig` tool in local mode. 
Configuration changes that are made in local mode are not be reflected in the running
server configuration. 
If you save a conflicting configuration, you could corrupt the configuration.

In a deployment manager environment, configuration updates are available only if 
a scripting client is connected to a deployment manager.

When connected to a node agent or a managed application server, you are not able 
to update the configuration because the configurations for these server processes
are copies of the master configuration that resides in the deployment manager. 
The copies are created on a node machine when a configuration synchronization occurs
between the deployment manager and the node agent.
Make configuration changes to the server processes by connecting a scripting client 
to a deployment manager. 

For this reason, to change a configuration, do not run a scripting client in 
local mode on a node machine.
It is not a supported configuration.
