"""
Use the `AdminApp` object to install, modify, and administer applications.

The `AdminApp` object interacts with the WebSphereÂ® Application Server management 
and configuration services to make application inquiries and changes. 
This interaction includes installing and uninstalling applications, listing modules, 
exporting, and so on.

You can start the scripting client when no server is running, if you want to 
use only local operations. 
To run in local mode, use the `-conntype NONE` option to start the scripting client. 
You receive a message that you are running in the local mode. 

Running the `AdminApp` object in local mode when a server is currently running is not recommended. 
This is because any configuration changes made in local mode will not be reflected in
the running server configuration and vice versa. 
If you save a conflicting configuration, you could corrupt the configuration.
