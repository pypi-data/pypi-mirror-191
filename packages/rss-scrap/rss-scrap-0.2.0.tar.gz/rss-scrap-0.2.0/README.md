# RSS Scrap

rss-scrap is a command line utility which scraps contents of web pages and
converts them to RSS feeds. Specific web scrapers must be implemented for
each page.

rss-scrap works asynchronously, meaning that many web pages can be scraped
simultaneously.

Currently scraping for the following pages is implemented:

- The Economist, World This Week section
- Wikipedia Current Events
- Warnings of Główny Inspektorat Sanitarny (Polish Government Agency)
