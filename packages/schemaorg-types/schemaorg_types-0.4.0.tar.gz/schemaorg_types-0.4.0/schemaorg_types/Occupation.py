    Attributes:
        potentialAction: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
        mainEntityOfPage: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.
        subjectOf: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
        url: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of the item.
        alternateName: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): An alias for the item.
        sameAs: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
        description: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A description of the item.
        disambiguatingDescription: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
        identifier: (Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]): The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
        image: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
        name: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The name of the item.
        additionalType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
        occupationLocation: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]):  The region/country for which this occupational description is appropriate. Note that educational requirements and qualifications can vary between jurisdictions.
        skills: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A statement of knowledge, skill, ability, task or any other assertion expressing a competency that is desired or required to fulfill this role or to work in this occupation.
        experienceRequirements: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Description of skills and experience needed for the position or Occupation.
        qualifications: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Specific qualifications required for this role or Occupation.
        educationRequirements: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Educational background needed for the position or Occupation.
        estimatedSalary: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any, StrictInt, StrictFloat]], str, Any, StrictInt, StrictFloat]]): An estimated salary for a job posting or occupation, based on a variety of variables including, but not limited to industry, job title, and location. Estimated salaries  are often computed by outside organizations rather than the hiring organization, who may not have committed to the estimated value.
        occupationalCategory: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A category describing the job, preferably using a term from a taxonomy such as [BLS O*NET-SOC](http://www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy.html), [ISCO-08](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/) or similar, with the property repeated for each applicable value. Ideally the taxonomy should be identified, and both the textual label and formal code for the category should be provided.Note: for historical reasons, any textual label and formal code provided as a literal may be assumed to be from O*NET-SOC.
        responsibilities: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Responsibilities associated with this role or Occupation.
