    Attributes:
        potentialAction: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
        mainEntityOfPage: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.
        subjectOf: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
        url: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of the item.
        alternateName: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): An alias for the item.
        sameAs: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
        description: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A description of the item.
        disambiguatingDescription: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
        identifier: (Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]): The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
        image: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
        name: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The name of the item.
        additionalType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
        serviceArea: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The geographic area where the service is provided.
        availableLanguage: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A language someone may use with or at the item, service or place. Please use one of the language codes from the [IETF BCP 47 standard](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). See also [[inLanguage]].
        productSupported: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The product or service this support contact point is related to (such as product support for a particular product line). This can be a specific product or product line (e.g. "iPhone") or a general category of products or services (e.g. "smartphones").
        areaServed: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided.
        contactOption: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): An option available on this contact point (e.g. a toll-free number or support for hearing-impaired callers).
        email: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Email address.
        contactType: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A person or organization can have different contact points, for different purposes. For example, a sales contact point, a PR contact point and so on. This property is used to specify the kind of contact point.
        hoursAvailable: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The hours during which this service or contact is available.
        faxNumber: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The fax number.
        telephone: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The telephone number.
        addressLocality: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The locality in which the street address is, and which is in the region. For example, Mountain View.
        postOfficeBoxNumber: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The post office box number for PO box addresses.
        streetAddress: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The street address. For example, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy.
        addressCountry: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The country. For example, USA. You can also provide the two-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).
        postalCode: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The postal code. For example, 94043.
        addressRegion: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The region in which the locality is, and which is in the country. For example, California or another appropriate first-level [Administrative division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_by_country).
