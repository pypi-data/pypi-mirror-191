    Attributes:
        potentialAction: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
        mainEntityOfPage: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.
        subjectOf: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
        url: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of the item.
        alternateName: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): An alias for the item.
        sameAs: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
        description: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A description of the item.
        disambiguatingDescription: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
        identifier: (Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]): The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
        image: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
        name: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The name of the item.
        additionalType: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]]): An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
        applicationDeadline: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any, date]], str, Any, date]]): The date at which the program stops collecting applications for the next enrollment cycle.
        timeToComplete: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The expected length of time to complete the program if attending full-time.
        timeOfDay: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The time of day the program normally runs. For example, "evenings".
        provider: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller.
        termsPerYear: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any, StrictInt, StrictFloat]], str, Any, StrictInt, StrictFloat]]): The number of times terms of study are offered per year. Semesters and quarters are common units for term. For example, if the student can only take 2 semesters for the program in one year, then termsPerYear should be 2.
        termDuration: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The amount of time in a term as defined by the institution. A term is a length of time where students take one or more classes. Semesters and quarters are common units for term.

        salaryUponCompletion: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The expected salary upon completing the training.
        hasCourse: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): A course or class that is one of the learning opportunities that constitute an educational / occupational program. No information is implied about whether the course is mandatory or optional; no guarantee is implied about whether the course will be available to everyone on the program.
        educationalCredentialAwarded: (Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]): A description of the qualification, award, certificate, diploma or other educational credential awarded as a consequence of successful completion of this course or program.
        typicalCreditsPerTerm: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, int, Any]], str, int, Any]]): The number of credits or units a full-time student would be expected to take in 1 term however 'term' is defined by the institution.

        programType: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): The type of educational or occupational program. For example, classroom, internship, alternance, etc.
        programPrerequisites: (Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]): Prerequisites for enrolling in the program.
        educationalProgramMode: (Union[List[Union[str, AnyUrl, Any]], str, AnyUrl, Any]): Similar to courseMode, the medium or means of delivery of the program as a whole. The value may either be a text label (e.g. "online", "onsite" or "blended"; "synchronous" or "asynchronous"; "full-time" or "part-time") or a URL reference to a term from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. https://ceds.ed.gov/element/001311#Asynchronous ).

Ideally the taxonomy should be identified, and both the textual label and formal code for the category should be provided.Note: for historical reasons, any textual label and formal code provided as a literal may be assumed to be from O*NET-SOC.
        startDate: (Optional[Union[List[Union[datetime, str, Any, date]], datetime, str, Any, date]]): The start date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).

Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
        trainingSalary: (Optional[Union[List[Union[str, Any]], str, Any]]): The estimated salary earned while in the program.
        endDate: (Optional[Union[List[Union[datetime, str, Any, date]], datetime, str, Any, date]]): The end date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
