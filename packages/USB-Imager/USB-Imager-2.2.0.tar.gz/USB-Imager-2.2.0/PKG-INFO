## 1. Features

- Very fast writing by using linux system call `sendfile()` and large write buffers
- Writing an image to multiple USB sticks at once
- Optional validation after writing
- Adjustable write buffer between 4 KiB and 8 MiB
- Automatic device detection
- Detection and elimination of the following states of a device before writing:
    - Mounted
- Writing support for hybrid ISOs by checking the MBR signature
- Shows stats about writing time and overall speed

Planned:

- Deactivation of LVM2 volumes before writing
- Multilanguage support
- Distribution package support (DEB, RPM, Arch-Linux PKG)
- Redesign with own dark/light theme


## 2. Installation

- **pip / pipenv:**

    If the distribution's own package manager is not supported yet, the USB-Imager can alternatively be installed via the Python package manager `pip`.

    ```bash
    $ pip install usb-imager
    $ pip uninstall usb-imager
    ```

    or [pipenv]:

    ```bash
    $ pipenv install usb-imager
    $ pipenv run usb-imager
    $ pipenv uninstall usb-imager
    ```


## 3. Usage

Start USB-Imager via the desktop icon or just type `usb-imager` in your terminal window.


## 4. Troubleshooting:

On some Linux distributions `USB-Imager` cannot be started from the command line or from a desktop icon after installation via `pip`.

- Suggested solution for command line::

    ~/.local/bin may not be included in the executable search path due to a [bug], you have to manually add the directory to the PATH environment variable by adding it to ~/.profile in this case.

    ```bash
    $ PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
    ```
