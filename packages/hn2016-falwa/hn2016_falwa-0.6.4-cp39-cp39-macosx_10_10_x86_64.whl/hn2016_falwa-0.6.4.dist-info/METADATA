hn2016_falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude
local wave activity (FALWA) and reference state (Uref) in the following papers:

- Huang and Nakamura (2016, JAS)
- Huang and Nakamura (2017, GRL)
- Nakamura and Huang (2018, Science)
- Neal et al (2022, GRL)

The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical barotropic model and QGPV fields on isobaric surfaces.

The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean) finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
