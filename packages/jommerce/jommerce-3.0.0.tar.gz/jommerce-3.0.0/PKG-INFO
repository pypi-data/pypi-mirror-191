# Why does this package exist?
Because 80% of customer projects have common apps 
such as authentication, store, admin, blog, forum, academy, etc. 
Therefore, as freelancers, we decided to code all these apps only once in one place 
and use them in different projects as often as desired, 
and all these apps can be customized by the settings of each project.
This helps to save our time and increase our income in exchange for doing projects.
