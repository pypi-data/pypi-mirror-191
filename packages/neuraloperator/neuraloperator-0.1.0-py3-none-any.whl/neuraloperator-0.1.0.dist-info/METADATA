Neural Operator
===============

Installation
------------

Just clone the repository and install locally (in editable mode so changes in the code are immediately reflected without having to reinstall):

.. code::

  git clone https://github.com/NeuralOperator/neuraloperator
  cd neuraloperator
  pip install -e .


Using with weights and biases
-----------------------------

Create a file in `neuraloperator/config` called `wandb_api_key.txt` and paste your Weights and Biases API key there.
You can configure the project you want to use and your username in the main yaml configuration files.
