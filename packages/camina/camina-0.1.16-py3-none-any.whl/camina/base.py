Contents:
    Bunch (Collection, abc.ABC): base class for general containers in camina. 
        It requires subclasses to have 'add', 'delete', and 'subset' methods.
    Proxy (Container): basic wrapper for a stored python object. Dunder methods 
        attempt to intelligently apply access methods to either the wrapper or 
        the wrapped item.   
          
To Do:
    Fix Proxy setter. Currently, the wrapper and wrapped are not being set at
        the right time, likely due to the inner workings of 'hasattr'.
    Add more dunder methods to address less common and fringe cases for use
        of a Proxy class.

class Bunch(Collection, abc.ABC):
    """Base class for general camina collections.
  
    A Bunch differs from a general python Collection in 4 ways:
        1) It must include an 'add' method which provides the default mechanism
            for adding new items to the collection. 'add' allows a subclass to 
            designate the preferred method of adding to the collections's stored 
            data without replacing other access methods.
        2) It must include a 'delete' method which provides the default
            mechanism for deleting items in the collection. 'delete' is called 
            by the '__delitem__' dunder method to delete stored items.
        3) A subclass must include a 'subset' method with optional 'include' and
            'exclude' parameters for returning a subset of the Bunch subclass.
        4) It supports the '+' operator being used to join a Bunch subclass 
            instance of the same python type (mapping, sequence, tuple, etc.). 
            The '+' operator calls the Bunch subclass 'add' method to implement 
            how the added item(s) is/are added to the Bunch subclass instance.

class Proxy(Container):
    """Mostly transparent wrapper class.
    
    A Proxy differs than an ordinary container in 2 significant ways:
        1) Access methods for getting, setting, and deleting that try to 
            intelligently direct the user's call to the proxy or stored object.
            So, for example, when a user tries to set an attribute on the proxy,
            the method will replace an attribute that exists in the proxy if
            one exists. But if there is no such attribute, the set method is
            applied to the object stored in 'contents'.
        2) When an 'in' call is made, the '__contains__' method first looks to
            see if the item is stored in 'contents' (if 'contents' is a 
            collection). If that check gets an errorr, the method then checks
            if the item is equivalent to 'contents'. This allows a Proxy to be
            agnostic as to the type of item(s) in 'contents' while returning the
            expected result from an 'in' call.

    Args:
        contents (Optional[Any]): any stored item(s). Defaults to None.

        Add more dunder methods to address less common and fringe cases for use
