# mistery

``mistery`` (c.f. "MIST query") is a Python module for retrieving data
from the [MESA Isochrones and Stellar
Tracks](http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/) (MIST) database of stellar
models.  The module allows you to fetch data by submitting requests to
the web interpolator.  It is intended as a lightweight teaching tool
that lets students access real-world stellar model data.  If you're
doing intensive scientific work, you're probably better off accessing
the data in other ways (e.g. by downloading [packaged model
grids](http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/model_grids.html)).

To use ``mistery``, copy the module file ``mistery.py`` to somewhere
your Python interpreter will find it (e.g. your working directory or
somewhere in your ``$PYTHON_PATH``).  Then fetch a single track with

```python
    track = mistery.get_track(M=3.1081, FeH=-0.8128)
```

The data is returned as a structured NumPy array. i.e. you can access
the columns by name rather than number.  To see a list of names, use

```python
    print(track.dtype.names)
```

and access columns with statements like ``track['log_L']``.

You can download multiple tracks in one call by instead passing an
iterable of masses to ``mistery.get_tracks``, e.g.

```python
    tracks = mistery.get_tracks(M=[1.086718, 2.8511], FeH=0.012756)
```

The data in ``tracks`` is now a list of tracks and can be accessed
with e.g. ``tracks[0]['log_L']``.
