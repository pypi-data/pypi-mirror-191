## LMQG: Language Model for Question Generation ðŸš€
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13izkdp2l7G2oeh_fwL7xJdR_67HMK_hQ?usp=sharing)

The `lmqg` is a python library to fine-tune seq2seq language models ([T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf), [BART](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461.pdf)) 
on the question generation task and provide an API to host the model prediction via [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/).
Let's install `lmqg` via pip first.
```shell
pip install lmqg
```

### Generate Question & Answer

- ***Generate Question on Answers:*** This is a basic usecase of our QG models, where user provides a paragraph and an answer to generate a question that is answerable by the answer given the paragraph.
See [MODEL CARD](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/blob/master/QG_BENCH.md#qg-models) for the available models.

```python
from lmqg import TransformersQG
# initialize model
model = TransformersQG(language='en', model='lmqg/t5-large-squad-qg')
# a list of paragraph
context = [
    "William Turner was an English painter who specialised in watercolour landscapes",
    "William Turner was an English painter who specialised in watercolour landscapes"
]
# a list of answer (same size as the context)
answer = [
    "William Turner",
    "English"
]
# model prediction
question = model.generate_q(list_context=context, list_answer=answer)
print(question)
[
    'Who was an English painter who specialised in watercolour landscapes?',
    'What nationality was William Turner?'
]
```

- ***Generate Question & Answer Pairs:*** Instead of specifying an answer, user can let QG model to generate an answer on the paragraph, and generate question on it sequentially.
This functionality is only available for the QG models fine-tuned with answer extraction see [MODEL CARD](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/blob/master/QG_BENCH.md#models-with-answer-extraction) for the full list of models with answer extraction (model alias usually has a suffix of `-qg-ae`).
  
```python
from lmqg import TransformersQG
# initialize model
model = TransformersQG(language='en', model='lmqg/t5-large-squad-qg-ae')
# paragraph to generate pairs of question and answer
context = "William Turner was an English painter who specialised in watercolour landscapes. He is often known as William Turner of Oxford or just Turner of Oxford to distinguish him from his contemporary, J. M. W. Turner. Many of Turner's paintings depicted the countryside around Oxford. One of his best known pictures is a view of the city of Oxford from Hinksey Hill."
# model prediction
question_answer = model.generate_qa(context)
# the output is a list of tuple (question, answer)
print(question_answer)
[
    ('Who was an English painter who specialised in watercolour landscapes?', 'William Turner'),
    ("What was William Turner's nickname?", 'William Turner of Oxford'),
    ("What did many of Turner's paintings depict around Oxford?", 'countryside'),
    ("What is one of William Turner's best known paintings?", 'a view of the city of Oxford')
]
```


### Model Evaluation
The evaluation tool reports `BLEU4`, `ROUGE-L`, `METEOR`, `BERTScore`, and `MoverScore` following [QG-Bench](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/blob/master/QG_BENCH.md).
From command line, run following command 
```shell
lmqg-eval -m "lmqg/t5-large-squad-qg" -e "./eval_metrics" -d "lmqg/qg_squad" -l "en"
```
where `-m` is a model alias on huggingface or path to local checkpoint, `-e` is the directly to export the metric file, `-d` is the dataset to evaluate, and `-l` is the language of the test set.
Instead of running model prediction, you can provide a prediction file instead to avoid computing it each time.
```shell
lmqg-eval --hyp-test '{your prediction file}' -e "./eval_metrics" -d "lmqg/qg_squad" -l "en"
```
The prediction file should be a text file of model generation in each line in the order of `test` split in the target dataset
([sample](https://huggingface.co/lmqg/t5-large-squad/raw/main/eval/samples.validation.hyp.paragraph_sentence.question.lmqg_qg_squad.default.txt)).
Check `lmqg-eval -h` to display all the options.

### Model Training
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/master/assets/grid_search.png" width="650">
</p>

To fine-tune QG model, we employ a two-stage hyper-parameter optimization, described as above diagram.
Following command is to run the fine-tuning with parameter optimization.
```shell
lmqg-train-search -c "tmp_ckpt" -d "lmqg/qg_squad" -m "t5-small" -b 64 --epoch-partial 5 -e 15 --language "en" --n-max-config 1 \
  -g 2 4 --lr 1e-04 5e-04 1e-03 --label-smoothing 0 0.15
```
Check `lmqg-train-search -h` to display all the options.

Fine-tuning models in python follows below.  
```python
from lmqg import GridSearcher
trainer = GridSearcher(
    checkpoint_dir='tmp_ckpt',
    dataset_path='lmqg/qg_squad',
    model='t5-small',
    epoch=15,
    epoch_partial=5,
    batch=64,
    n_max_config=5,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=[2, 4], 
    lr=[1e-04, 5e-04, 1e-03],
    label_smoothing=[0, 0.15]
)
trainer.run()
```


## AutoQG

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/master/assets/autoqg.gif" width="500">
</p>

***AutoQG ([https://autoqg.net](https://autoqg.net/))*** is a free web application hosting our QG models.
The QG models are listed at the [QG-Bench page](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation/blob/master/QG_BENCH.md).

## Rest API with huggingface inference API

We provide a rest API which hosts the model inference through huggingface inference API. You need huggingface API token to run your own API and install dependencies as below.
```shell
pip install lmqg[api]
```
Swagger UI is available at [`http://127.0.0.1:8088/docs`](http://127.0.0.1:8088/docs), when you run the app locally (replace the address by your server address).

### Build
- Build/Run Local (command line):
```shell
export API_TOKEN={Your Huggingface API Token}
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8088
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088
```

- Build/Run Local (docker):
```shell
docker build -t lmqg/app:latest . --build-arg api_token={Your Huggingface API Token}
docker run -p 8080:8080 lmqg/app:latest
```

### API Description
You must pass the huggingface api token via the environmental variable `API_TOKEN`.
The main endpoint is `question_generation`, which has following parameters,

| Parameter        | Description                                                                         |

| **input_text**   | input text, a paragraph or a sentence to generate question |
| **language**     | language |
| **qg_model**     | question generation model |
| **answer_model** | answer extraction model |

and return a list of dictionaries with `question` and `answer`. 
```shell
{
  "qa": [
    {"question": "Who founded Nintendo Karuta?", "answer": "Fusajiro Yamauchi"},
    {"question": "When did Nintendo distribute its first video game console, the Color TV-Game?", "answer": "1977"}
  ]
}
