# CCDFits

This package provides utilities to work with .fits files that were taken with CCDs. It provides a FITS class to easily view and analyse images, along with useful functions to process them. It is particularly useful for Skipper CCD images, which can be calibrated by fitting gaussians to the zero- and one-electron peaks.

## Installation

I strongly recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create a virtual environment and install ccdfits and pre-requisites there.

### Pre-requisites

This library has been developed for Python 3. It will not build in Python 2.

`ccdfits` requires the following packages to be installed:
* numpy
* scipy
* astropy
* matplotlib

In addition, if you intend to use `ccdfits.processing`, you will also need to install:
* scikit-learn (for `cal2phys`)
* scikit-image (for `generateMask`)

### Installing in a conda environment

Create a new environment and install the prerequisites:

`conda create --name ccdfits numpy scipy astropy matplotlib`

Activate the newly created environment:

`conda activate ccdfits`

Install ccdfits via pip:

`pip install ccdfits`


### Installing latest public version (may be different from that on pypi)

`pip install git+https://gitlab.com/nicolaseavalos/ccdfits.git`


### Installing elsewhere

Although not recommended, the following command should work in any case as long as pip for python 3 is installed in the system:

`pip3 install ccdfits`

## Usage

The following example shows how to load and view a .fits image. Replace `'ccd-image.fits'` with a string indicating the full or relative path to the image you are trying to load.

    # imports
    from ccdfits import Fits
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.ion()

    # set the image path
    fits_path = 'ccd-image.fits'

    # load and view the image
    img = Fits(fits_path)
    img.view()

Complete documentation is in process.
