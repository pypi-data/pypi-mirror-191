# Adding document data

Nifigator contains a PDFDocument object to extract text and paragraph and page offsets from a PDF document. It uses the Python package PDFMiner.six for this.

## Creating a NifContext from extracted text

```python
from nifigator import PDFDocument

# Extract text from a pdf
filename = "..//data//dnb-annual-report-2021.pdf"
with open(filename, mode="rb") as f:
    pdf = PDFDocument().parse(file=f.read())
```

Write the PDFDocument in xml format to a file with PDFDocument.write() and PDFDocument.getstream(), and open an already saved PDFDocument in xml format with PDFDocument.open().

It is often useful to transform the original url or location of a document to a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) when storing it.

```python
from nifigator import generate_uuid

original_uri = "https://www.dnb.nl/media/4kobi4vf/dnb-annual-report-2021.pdf"
uri = "https://dnb.nl/rdf-data/"+generate_uuid(uri=original_uri)
```

Then we construct the context

```python
from nifigator import NifContext, OffsetBasedString

# Make a context by passing uri, uri scheme and string
context = NifContext(
    uri=uri,
    URIScheme=OffsetBasedString,
    isString=pdf.text,
)
print(context)
```

```console
(nif:Context) uri = <https://dnb.nl/rdf-data/nif-5282967702ae37d486ad338b9771ca8f>
  isString : 'DNB Annual Report 2021\nStriking a \nnew balance\n\nDe Nederlandsche Bank N.V.\n2021
Annual Report\n\nStriking a new balance\n\nPresented to the General Meeting on 16 March
2022.\n\n1\n\nDNB Annual Report 2021The cut-off date for this report is 10 March
2022.\n\nNotes\n\nThe original Annual Report, including the financial statements, was prepared
in Dutch. In the event \n\nof discrepancies between the Dutch version and this English
translation, the Dutch version prevails. ... '
```

## Page offsets

In some situations it is necessary to know the specific page number that contains a certain part of the text.

```python
from nifigator import NifPage

# A list of NifPages is created using the page offsets from the pdf
pages = [
    NifPage(
        URIScheme=OffsetBasedString,
        uri=uri,
        beginIndex=page.beginIndex,
        endIndex=page.endIndex,
        referenceContext=context
    )
    for page in pdf.page_offsets]

# The list of pages are added to the context
context.set_Pages(pages)
```

```python
# The individual pages can be retrieved in the following way
context.pages[45]
```

```console
(nif:Page) uri = https://dnb.nl/rdf-data/nif-5282967702ae37d486ad338b9771ca8f#offset_105254_107257
  beginIndex : 105254
  endIndex : 107257
  anchorOf : 'Cash and payment systems\n\nConfidence in the payment system remained high in 2021. In a survey held in August 2021, 74% \n\nof\xa0respondents had a high or very high level of confidence in the payment system. Only 1% has \n\nlittle or very little confidence. We studied the drivers of confidence in the payment system for the \n\nfirst time in 2021 (see Figure 4).

'
```


The page offsets are aligned with the context string. 

```python
# The page offsets are aligned with the context string
for page in pdf.page_offsets[1:2]:
    print(repr(context.isString[page.beginIndex:page.endIndex]))
```

which gives

```console
'De Nederlandsche Bank N.V.\n2021 Annual Report\n\nStriking a new balance\n\nPresented to the General Meeting on 16 March 2022.\n\n1\n\nDNB Annual Report 2021'
```

By adding the linguistic data we can generate a complete graph:

```python
import stanza
nlp = stanza.Pipeline("en", verbose=False)
stanza_dict = nlp(context.isString).to_dict()
context.load_from_dict(stanza_dict)

from nifigator import NifContextCollection
collection = NifContextCollection(uri="https://dnb.nl/rdf-data/")
collection.add_context(context)

from nifigator import NifGraph
g = NifGraph(collection=collection)
```

and serialize the graph to a file in hext-format:

```python
g.serialize("..//data//"+generate_uuid(uri=original_uri)+".hext", format="hext")
```
